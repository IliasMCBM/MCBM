This publication is a contribution to the International Programme on Chemical
Safety.
The International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), established in 1980,
is a joint venture of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the
International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The overall objectives of the IPCS are to establish the scientific basis for assessing
the risk to human health and the environment from exposure to chemicals, through
international peer review processes as a prerequisite for the promotion of chemical
safety, and to provide technical assistance in strengthening national capacities for
the sound management of chemicals.
The Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals
(IOMC) was established in 1995 by UNEP, ILO, the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, WHO, the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Participating
Organizations), following recommendations made by the 1992 UN Conference on
Environment and Development to strengthen cooperation and increase
coordination in the field of chemical safety. The purpose of the IOMC is to promote
coordination of the policies and activities pursued by the Participating
Organizations, jointly or separately, to achieve the sound management of chemicals
in relation to human health and the environment.

PREFACE
The monographs contained in this volume were prepared at the sixty-ninth
meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA),
which met at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, on 17–26 June 2008. These
monographs summarize the data on selected food additives reviewed by the
Committee.
The sixty-ninth report of JECFA has been published by the World Health
Organization as WHO Technical Report No. 952. Reports and other documents
resulting from previous meetings of JECFA are listed in Annex 1. The participants
in the meeting are listed in Annex 3 of the present publication.
JECFA serves as a scientific advisory body to FAO, WHO, their Member States
and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, primarily through the Codex Committee
on Food Additives, the Codex Committee on Contaminants in Food and the Codex
Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods, regarding the safety of food
additives, residues of veterinary drugs, naturally occurring toxicants and
contaminants in food. Committees accomplish this task by preparing reports of their
meetings and publishing specifications or residue monographs and toxicological
monographs, such as those contained in this volume, on substances that they have
considered.
The monographs contained in the volume are based on working papers that
were prepared by temporary advisers. A special acknowledgement is given at the
beginning of each monograph to those who prepared these working papers. The
monographs were edited by M. Sheffer, Ottawa, Canada.
Many unpublished proprietary reports are unreferenced. These were voluntarily
submitted to the Committee by various producers of the food additives under review
and in many cases represent the only data available on those substances. The
temporary advisers based the working papers they wrote on all the data that were
submitted, and all these reports were available to the Committee when it made its
evaluations.
The preparation and editing of the monographs included in this volume were
made possible through the technical and financial contributions of the Participating
Organizations of the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), which
supports the activities of JECFA.

EXPLANATION

At the request of the Codex Committee on Food Additives at its Thirty-ninth
Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007), the Committee evaluated a
preparation containing the enzyme asparaginase derived from a genetically
modified strain of Aspergillus niger. The systematic name of asparaginase is Lasparagine amidohydrolase, and its Enzyme Commission (EC) number is 3.5.1.1.

4

ASPARAGINASE FROM ASPERGILLUS NIGER

The Committee had previously evaluated asparaginase from a genetically modified
strain of Aspergillus oryzae at its sixty-eighth meeting (Annex 1, reference 187).
Asparaginase catalyses the hydrolysis of the amino acid L-asparagine to L-aspartic
acid and ammonia. The enzyme is intended for use as a processing aid to reduce
in food the levels of free L-asparagine, which is a major precursor in the formation
of the food contaminant acrylamide. Asparaginase will be added to food prior to the
heating step and will be denatured and inactivated as a result of heat treatment.
1.1

Genetic modification

Asparaginase is manufactured by pure culture fermentation of a genetically
modified strain of A. niger that contains multiple copies of the asparaginase gene
derived from A. niger, which were inserted into predetermined loci in the A. niger
genome. Aspergillus niger is a filamentous fungus that commonly occurs in the
environment and is considered to be non-pathogenic. The asparaginase production
strain was constructed by transformation of the A. niger host strain DS 51563 with
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments derived from two plasmids, one containing
the asparaginase gene from A. niger and the other containing the acetamidase gene
from Aspergillus nidulans. The acetamidase gene was used as a selectable marker
to identify transformants and was subsequently removed from the production strain.
As a result, the asparaginase production strain contains multiple copies of the A.
niger asparaginase gene but no other heterologous genes. The asparaginase
production strain was evaluated for its potential to produce toxic secondary
metabolites, including ochratoxins. There was no indication of the formation of toxic
secondary metabolites under fermentation conditions used in the production of
asparaginase.
1.2

Product characterization

Asparaginase is secreted to the fermentation broth and is subsequently
purified and concentrated. The enzyme concentrate is formulated and standardized
into either a liquid or a granulated preparation using appropriate food-grade substances. The asparaginase preparation complies with the General Specifications
and Considerations for Enzyme Preparations Used in Food Processing prepared
by the Committee at its sixty-seventh meeting (Annex 1, reference 184) and does
not contain viable cells of the production organism. The total organic solids (TOS)
content of the asparaginase preparation may vary from 6% to 10%.
Asparaginase will be used during preparation of carbohydrate-rich foods that
are major sources of dietary acrylamide, such as bread and other cereal-based
products, baked and fried potato-based products, and reaction flavours (also known
as “thermal process flavours”). The asparaginase preparation will be added to these
foods prior to heat treatment in order to reduce the availability of L-asparagine for
acrylamide formation. Asparaginase will be inactivated by denaturing during the
heating/baking step. The TOS residues in the final food (including denatured
asparaginase) may range from 0.14 to 428 mg/kg of the final food. The effectiveness
of the asparaginase enzyme preparation in reducing acrylamide formation was not
evaluated by the Committee.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

5

The potential allergenicity of asparaginase was assessed according to the
bioinformatics criteria recommended in the Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Consultation on Allergenicity of Foods Derived from Biotechnology (FAO/WHO
Expert Consultation, 2001). The amino acid sequence of asparaginase was
compared with the amino acid sequences of known allergens in the Structural
Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP) from the University of Texas Medical
Branch (http://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/sdap_who.html). The database contains all
allergens from the web site of the International Union of Immunological Societies
(http://www.allergen.org), supplemented with data from the literature and protein
databases (SwissProt protein knowledgebase, Protein Information Resource [PIR],
National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] protein database and Protein
Data Bank [PDB]). The results of the sequence comparisons showed no amino acid
homology that would suggest cross-reactivity of asparaginase with known
allergens.
2.2

Toxicological studies

Toxicological studies were performed with the asparaginase enzyme using
a representative batch (APE0604), which was produced according to the procedure
used for commercial production. The liquid enzyme concentrate was spray-dried to
produce the final, non-formulated test substance, with an activity of 34 552
asparaginase units (ASPU)/g and a TOS value of 89.7%. To obtain the commercial
enzyme preparation, the liquid enzyme concentrate was stabilized and standardized by addition of glycerol or spray-dried and granulated with either maltodextrin
or wheat flour and subsequently standardized with the same carrier.
2.2.1 Acute toxicity
No information was available.
2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
In a study conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
requirements and largely to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) Test Guideline 408, groups of 20 male and 20 female Wistar
outbred (Crl:WI(WU) BR) rats received diets containing asparaginase (batch
APE0604) at a concentration of 0, 0.2, 0.6 or 1.8% by weight (w/w) for 13 weeks.
The dose selection was based on the results of an earlier 2-week range-finding
study in rats, where concentrations of asparaginase up to 1.8% (w/w) in the diet did
not produce any adverse effects (Lina, 2006a). Since no correction was made for
changes in rat body weight over the duration of the study, the actual daily dose
slightly declined. The average daily dose in each group was calculated to be 0, 130,
391 and 1157 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day, respectively, in males and 0, 151,
452 and 1331 mg/kg bw per day, respectively, in females. The experimental
parameters determined were clinical signs, body weight, food consumption,

neurobehavioural testing (arena testing, functional observational battery and motor
activity), ophthalmic end-points, haematological parameters, clinical chemical endpoints and urinalysis parameters, gross and microscopic appearance and organ
weights. Urine for urinalysis and blood for haematology and clinical chemistry were
collected from 10 rats per sex per dose on days 8 and 44 of treatment and then in
all rats (20 per sex) during necropsy (days 91/92). Ophthalmoscopy was performed
before treatment in all rats and then only in the control and high-dose groups on day
85 of treatment. All other measurements were performed on days 91/92 only.
There were no treatment-related effects observed for mortality, clinical signs,
body weight gain, food consumption, food conversion efficiency, neurobehaviour or
ophthalmoscopy. A few transient changes in clinical chemistry and haematology
parameters that achieved statistical significance were observed, such as an
elevated monocyte count in high-dose males after 8 days and reduced basophils in
all treated males after 13 weeks. These changes were considered to have no
toxicological significance because they were not related to dose or dose duration
and values were well within the historical data. The reduced sorbitol dehydrogenase
activity observed after 8 days in high-dose males and mid- and high-dose females
was not considered to be toxicologically significant because these findings were not
confirmed at later stages in the study or associated with any changes in liver
histopathology. In both sexes, organ weights, macroscopic pathology and histopathology were unaffected by treatment. Overall, it can be concluded that the noobserved-effect level (NOEL) is 1157 mg/kg bw per day (i.e. 1038 mg TOS/kg bw
per day), the highest dose tested in this study (Lina, 2006b).
2.2.3 Long-term studies of toxicity and carcinogenicity
No information was available.
2.2.4 Genotoxicity
The results of two in vitro studies of genotoxicity with asparaginase (batch
APE0604) are summarized in Table 1. The first study was conducted in accordance
with OECD Test Guideline 471 (Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test), whereas the
second was conducted in accordance with OECD Test Guideline 473 (In Vitro
Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test). Both studies were certified for
compliance with GLP.
2.2.5 Reproductive toxicity

Multigeneration studies

No multigeneration studies were available.

mated Wistar outbred (Crl:WI(WU) BR) rats received diets containing asparaginase
(batch APE0604) at a concentration of 0, 0.2, 0.6 or 1.8% (w/w) from gestation
day 0 (sperm-positive smear) to gestation day 21. The dose selection was based
on the results of an earlier 2-week range-finding study in rats, where dietary concentrations of asparaginase up to 1.8% (w/w) did not produce any adverse effects
(Lina, 2006a). Since there was no dose correction for changes in the pregnant rat
body weight over the duration of the treatment, the actual daily dose declined from
153 to 84 mg/kg bw per day in the low-dose group; from 449 to 238 mg/kg bw per
day in the mid-dose group; and from 1349 to 721 mg/kg bw per day in the high-dose
group. The mean doses achieved over the treatment period were 136, 403 and
1205 mg/kg bw per day in the low-, mid- and high-dose groups, respectively.
All rats were checked at least once daily for mortality and clinical signs of
toxicity; body weight and food consumption were recorded every 3–4 days until day
21 of gestation. On day 21 of gestation, all rats were sacrificed and examined
macroscopically. The uterus and ovaries were removed, and the weight of the full
uterus, the number of corpora lutea and the number and distribution of implantation
sites were recorded. Post-implantation losses were classified as early or late
resorptions or dead fetuses. Conception rate, pre-implantation loss and postimplantation loss were recorded. At necropsy, each fetus was weighed, sexed and
examined macroscopically for external findings. The condition of the placentae, the
umbilical cords, the fetal membranes and fluids was examined, and individual
placental weights were recorded. Approximately half of the fetuses from each litter
were examined for visceral abnormalities, whereas the remainder were examined
for skeletal abnormalities.
There were no deaths, no treatment-related clinical signs and no effects
on litter or fetal parameters, and pathology in adults was unaffected. Similarly,
food consumption and body weight were unaffected by treatment. Multiple

8

malformations were observed in a low-dose and a mid-dose fetus during external
and skeletal/visceral examinations. These malformations were not regarded as
being treatment related. This conclusion was based on the absence of a correlation with dose and the absence of effects on litter data, post-implantation loss, live
and dead fetuses, resorptions, and fetal and placental weight. In conclusion, no
treatment-related effects were observed following external, visceral and skeletal
examinations. The NOEL in this study of embryotoxicity/teratogenicity in rats was
1205 mg/kg bw per day (i.e. 1081 mg TOS/kg bw per day), the highest dose tested
in the study (Tegelenbosch-Schouten, 2006).

DIETARY EXPOSURE

3.1

Overseas food categories and use levels

The A. niger asparaginase preparation is to be used in L-asparagine- and
carbohydrate-containing foods that are heated above 120 °C, such as bread
and other baked cereal-based products, baked or fried potato-based products
and reaction flavours, to reduce the formation of acrylamide. The enzyme is added
before the heating step of the respective food. During heating, the enzyme is
inactivated through denaturation of the protein. Depending on the application, use
levels ranging from 20 to 15 000 ASPU/kg flour were recommended by the
petitioner, corresponding to 0.14–428 mg TOS/kg food in the finished processed
foods (Table 2).

In all applications, the action of asparaginase takes place before the heating
step. Because all intended applications involve heating above 120 °C, no enzyme
activity (enzyme is inactivated or denatured at temperatures above 70 °C) is
expected to remain in the finished processed product.
Experimental data were submitted to the Committee on the efficiency of
the addition of asparaginase from A. niger in reducing levels of acrylamide, correlated with the reduction of L-asparagine, in several finished products (DSM Food
Specialties, 2007). For example:

• Depending on the type of bread (e.g. French batard, potato bread, corn bread
•
•
•

and Dutch tin bread) and amount of enzyme added, acrylamide formation is
reduced from 36% to 75% in bread crusts.
Addition of asparaginase to cereal flours before baking for many baked products,
such as crackers, cakes, cookies, Dutch honey cake and tortilla chips, reduces
acrylamide formation up to 90%.
Addition of asparaginase to potato-based dough before frying has been shown
to reduce the level of formation of acrylamide from 86% up to 93% after frying.
Addition of asparaginase to savoury ingredients such as meat extracts (roasted
beef flavour) and yeast extracts results in reduction of acrylamide formation by
more than 70%.

3.2

Assessment of per capita dietary exposure based on data from food
balance sheets

An international assessment based on data from food balance sheets has
been performed using the 13 Consumption Cluster Diets of the Global Environment
Monitoring System – Food Contamination Monitoring and Assessment Programme
(GEMS/Food) categorization (Annex 1, reference 177). In this assessment, per
capita daily consumption of cereals and root and tuber commodities from the
13 cluster diets combined with the maximum use levels proposed by the petitioner
for the corresponding food category (Table 2) were used to estimate dietary
exposure to asparaginase.
Per capita dietary exposure for asparaginase from A. niger was estimated
to range from 0.8 mg TOS/kg bw per day (cluster C) to 3.7 mg TOS/kg bw per day
(cluster A), assuming a 60-kg body weight. Roots and tubers were estimated to be
the highest contributor to the total per capita dietary exposure, up to 60% in all
cluster diets.
3.3

Assessment based on individual dietary records

The daily dietary exposure estimated by the petitioner was calculated based
on the maximal use levels and consumption data in the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom and the USA. It is noted that the categorization of foods in these countries
does not overlap. Moreover, the categories of foods are generally broader than the
actual applications of asparaginase. As a worst-case situation, Table 3 presents the
daily dietary exposure to (denatured) asparaginase in the Netherlands, which
corresponds to the highest exposure reported by the petitioner.

The consumption level of the average Dutch population is taken from the Dutch food
consumption survey (Voedingscentrum, 1998), and the 90th-percentile consumption intake
is assumed to be 2 times the average consumption level (Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition, 2006).

Calculated for a 60-kg person; 90th-percentile daily dietary exposures for each commodity
have been summed for the total.

Food categories: i) cereals and cereal products, ii) cake and biscuits.

Food category: potatoes, which includes—apart from crisps and cookies made from potato

f
Food categories: i) soups, ii) fats, oils and savoury sauces, iii) mixed dishes and iv) processed

The consumption data for potato-based products include potatoes and fries,
whereas asparaginase is meant to be used merely in crisps and cookies made from
potato meal. As a result, the estimated daily dietary exposure is considered to be
conservative.
An estimate of dietary exposure to (denatured) asparaginase was made by
the Committee at the present meeting based on the Concise European Food
Consumption Database for the adult population (16–64 years old), published by the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2008 (European Food Safety Authority,
2008). This database compiles mean and high percentiles of individual food
consumption for 15 broad food categories from the majority of European countries
(n = 17). Mean and high consumption amounts of cereals and cereal products and
starchy root or potato products by European Union (EU) member states were
combined with the maximum use levels proposed by the petitioner for the
corresponding food commodities (Table 2). According to the guidance document
for the use of the concise database provided by EFSA in doing exposure
assessment calculations, the dietary exposure for high-level consumers was
derived by summing the 95th-percentile consumption for two food groups and the
mean consumption for all other food groups (EFSA, 2008). Here, as only two food

groups were considered, the dietary exposure for high-level consumers was derived
by summing the 95th-percentile consumption of these two food groups.
Total estimates of dietary exposure to asparaginase in the EU adult
population, assuming a 60-kg average body weight, ranged from 0.5 to 1.7 mg TOS/
kg bw per day for mean consumption and from 1.1 to 4.1 mg TOS/kg bw per day
for the 95th percentile of consumers (Table 4). The Committee noted that these
results were conservative because it was assumed that the two broad food
categories were consumed at the highest reported use levels.

COMMENTS

4.1

Toxicological data

Toxicological studies were performed with the asparaginase enzyme using
a representative batch (APE0604), which was produced according to the procedure
used for commercial production. The liquid enzyme concentrate was spray-dried to
produce the final, non-formulated test substance, with an average activity of 34 552
ASPU/g and a TOS value of 89.7% before addition to the feed. In a 13-week study
of general toxicity and a study of developmental toxicity in rats, no significant
treatment-related effects were seen when this material was administered in the feed
at concentrations of up to 1.8% (w/w). Therefore, 1038 mg TOS/kg bw per day, the
highest dose tested, was taken to be the NOEL. Asparaginase was not mutagenic
in an assay for mutagenicity in bacteria in vitro and was not clastogenic in an assay
for chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells in vitro.

ASPARAGINASE FROM ASPERGILLUS NIGER

Asparaginase was evaluated for potential allergenicity according to the
bioinformatics criteria recommended by the FAO/WHO Expert Consultation (2001).
The amino acid sequence of asparaginase was compared with the amino acid
sequences of known allergens. No sequence homology that would suggest that
asparaginase is an allergen was identified.
4.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

An estimate of dietary exposure was made by the Committee based on the
13 Consumption Cluster Diets of the GEMS/Food categorization and on the Concise
European Food Consumption Database for the adult population (age 16–64 years).
The European database compiles mean and high percentiles of individual food
consumption for 15 broad food categories from the majority of European countries
(n = 17). The GEMS/Food cluster diets report per capita daily consumption of food
commodities. In these estimates, reported consumption data have been combined
with the maximum use levels recommended. This corresponds to 23 mg TOS/kg
food for cereal-based products and 428 mg TOS/kg food for potato-based products.
For the GEMS/Food data, the food categories used in the calculation were cereals
and root and tuber commodities. For the European database, the food categories
used were cereals and cereal products and starchy root or potato products.
The potential dietary exposure to asparaginase from A. niger based on
international and national conservative estimates for the adult population, assuming
a body weight of 60 kg, range from 0.5 to 3.7 mg TOS/kg bw per day (0.5–1.7 mg
TOS/kg bw per day for Europe and 0.8–3.7 mg TOS/kg bw per day based on GEMS/
Food cluster diets) for mean consumers and from 1.1 to 4.1 mg TOS/kg bw per day
for high-percentile consumers (95th percentile) in Europe.
The Committee noted that these results were conservative because they
assume the consumption of foods from two (of the 15) broad food categories, both
of which contained asparaginase at the highest reported use levels.
5.

EVALUATION

Comparing the most conservative estimate of exposure (i.e. 4.1 mg TOS/kg
bw per day) with the NOEL of 1038 mg TOS/kg bw per day from the 13-week study
of oral toxicity, the margin of exposure is about 250. The Committee allocated an
acceptable daily intake (ADI) “not specified” for asparaginase from A. niger
expressed in A. niger used in the applications specified and in accordance with good
manufacturing practice.

EXPLANATION

This substance, under the name “ligninsulfonate”, was placed on the agenda
of the present meeting at the request of the Codex Committee on Food Additives
at its Thirty-ninth Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007) for assessment
of safety, specification and dietary exposure. The Committee received information
only on calcium lignosulfonate and decided to refer to the specified material as
“calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)” to distinguish it from other calcium lignosulfonates
on the market. The number included in the name of the additive reflects the weightaverage molecular weight range (40 000–65 000) specified in the specifications
monograph developed by the Committee at its present meeting. Calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) is intended for use as a carrier of encapsulated food
ingredients. It has not been evaluated previously by the Committee.

1.1

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

Chemical and technical considerations

Calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) is an amorphous light yellow-brown to brown
powder obtained from the sulfite pulping of soft wood; it is derived from lignin, the
second largest component of wood. The additive is soluble in water, but not in
common organic solvents. Owing to its water solubility, calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) can serve as a protective colloid for formulations of fat-soluble vitamins,
carotenoids and food colours.
Lignosulfonates are commercially available as sodium and calcium salts and
have been used by industry in a wide variety of applications. The usefulness of
commercial products containing lignosulfonates comes from their dispersing,
binding, complexing and emulsifying properties. The additive calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) evaluated at the present meeting presents a higher degree of lignin
polymerization and a lower content of sugars than do other calcium lignosulfonates
on the market. The lignin framework of the additive is a sulfonated random polymer
of three aromatic alcohols (phenylpropane monomers): coniferyl alcohol,
p-coumaryl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, of which coniferyl alcohol is the principal
unit. The additive exhibits a weight-average molecular weight in the range of
40 000–65 000, with more than 90% of the polymer constituents having molecular
weights ranging from 1000 to 250 000.
Calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) is intended for use as a carrier for the
production of encapsulated fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and carotenoids
(e.g. ȕ-carotene, ȕ-apo-8ƍ-carotenal, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, lutein and
lycopene) to facilitate their introduction into water-based foods. It has an adequate
emulsifying and film-forming effect and viscosity that ensure the formation of
droplets of appropriate size in the final step of the encapsulation process. Potential
applications of the encapsulated ingredients include their uses in, for example, fruitbased beverages, vitamin drinks, dairy products and hard candies. The additive can
be used in much the same way as other water-soluble matrix materials, such as
gelatins, gum arabic, soya protein hydrolysates and modified starches.
The Committee reviewed data on stability studies with the additive itself, with
the additive in carotenoid preparations and with a ȕ-carotene/additive-containing
product used in a non-pasteurized, non-carbonated soft drink. The Committee
concluded that the stability of the additive is adequate for the intended uses.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Absorption, distribution and excretion
An in vitro study using the Caco-2 cell monolayer model was performed to
predict intestinal absorption of 3H-labelled calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) at
concentrations of 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/ml (Beck et al., 2006). The radiolabelled test
substance was prepared by catalytic hydrogen/tritium exchange of the spray-dried
test item dissolved in dimethylformamide and purified by repeated washing and

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

recondensation steps in water/methanol and filtration. Radioactivity in the samples
was determined after incubation times of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 h. Permeation of
radioactivity was low, at 1.7 ± 0.25% per hour, and essentially the same for all
concentrations. Molecular weight distribution of the absorbed radiolabelled products
as determined by size exclusion chromatography revealed that less than 1% of the
permeated compounds had molecular weight higher than 200. Most of the
radioactivity permeated was present in tritiated water formed by radiolysis from
[3H]lignosulfonate groups. The apparent permeability coefficient of lignosulfonate
with molecular weight higher than 200 calculated from these data is lower than
0.005 × 10í6 cm/s. From these results, no intestinal absorption of calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) and no systemic exposure are expected in vivo.
The absorption, distribution and excretion of 3H-labelled calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) were studied in male and female rats following administration
of a single oral dose (Beck & Rossi, 2005). Owing to the continuous formation of
low molecular weight compounds by radiolysis prior to application, the substance
was purified by ultrafiltration using centrifugal filter devices. The test substance was
administered by oral gavage in a single dose of 10 mg/kg body weight (bw). Plasma
kinetics of radioactivity were studied in a pilot study with three male rats from which
blood samples were taken at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. The overall fate of the radioactivity
was examined in these three animals and in the main study involving three males
and three females. For this purpose, urine and faeces were collected at two intervals
(0–24 h and 24–48 h). Animals were sacrificed by exsanguination at 48 h, blood
was collected, animals were dissected, and the weights of organs and tissues were
determined. Radioactivity was determined in all biological materials obtained after
sacrifice. Aliquots of samples from urine, faeces, blood and tissues were analysed
twice, before and after drying, in order to determine the presence of tritiated water.
The molecular weight distribution of radiolabelled substances in urine and plasma
was analysed by size exclusion chromatography.
The purity of the 3H-labelled test substance was analysed by size exclusion
chromatography, and a significant amount of radioactivity (>25%) in molecules of
low molecular weight was observed in radiolabelled samples as received from the
supplier. These small molecules were removed by repeated ultrafiltration steps, the
last of which was performed immediately before administration to the animal.
The test substance applied in the main study contained 2.71% of the
radiolabel in molecules of lower molecular weight. An analysis of purified samples
stored for 3 weeks showed release of approximately 25% of radioactivity from the
substance into molecules that elute at the retention time of tritiated water. It was
concluded that radiolysis of 3H-labelled lignosulfonate leads to the formation of
mainly tritiated water, which needs to be accounted for when considering the results
of the study.
The plasma kinetics of absorbed tritium activity in three male rats showed
that radioactivity levels peaked at 6 h, reaching 0.0015% of the administered dose
per gram of blood. This level remained almost unchanged until sacrifice at 48 h.
Size exclusion chromatographic analysis of the molecular weight distribution
showed that 98.5% of the radioactivity co-eluted with tritiated water (retention time

18

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

~24–26 min) and about 1% was found in fractions of higher molecular weight
(retention time <22 min).
Owing to the expected continuous formation of tritiated water during study
phase periods, the radioactivity present in the animal was studied in all biological
materials before and after drying (in urine and plasma, the amount of tritiated water
was determined by size exclusion chromatography). The results are summarized in

Approximately 75% of administered radioactivity was excreted via faeces,
90% of which was excreted within the first 24 h. Less than 3% of the radioactivity
was recovered in urine after 48 h, with almost equal amounts for each of the two
24-h collection intervals. Radioactivity levels in blood and liver were 0.6% and 0.7%,
respectively; the remaining carcass contained 13% of the total radioactive dose.
Apart from a slightly slower faecal excretion in females, no significant sex
differences were observed in tissue, blood or excreta levels. Removal of water by
drying tissue and other samples resulted in significantly lower radioactivity levels.
Whereas 95.3% of the radioactivity found in faeces was still detected after drying,
only around 5% of the radioactivity in liver, blood and the residual carcass was still
present after drying of the samples. The molecular weight distribution of 3H-labelled
components in liquid samples such as urine and plasma revealed that at least 97%
of the radioactivity eluted with very low molecular weight fractions (<200), and the
majority co-eluted with tritiated water.
The experimental design did not allow investigations as to whether the
radiolabel present in compounds of higher molecular weight was associated with

the test substance or resulted from non-aqueous hydrogen. Hydrogen tracer from
tritiated water is present in non-aqueous hydrogen (mainly protein and
carbohydrates) as a result of exchange reactions between molecules and water
(with and without enzymes). The reported tritium levels of 0.5–2% (Sheng &
Huggins, 1979) and 2–4% (Ellis, 2000) in non-aqueous hydrogen (resulting from
the presence of tritiated water) would possibly explain the observed levels of
radioactivity in molecules of higher weight in plasma (1%) and urine (3.2% at 24 h).
It should be noted that many soluble proteins have a molecular weight near to the
average molecular weight of the test substance and could therefore not be
separated under the chromatographic conditions applied.
In summary, after 48 h, only 0.8% of the radioactivity administered as
H-labelled calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) is found in urine (0.05%), liver (0.08%),
blood (0.01%) and the remaining carcass (0.66%). The study demonstrates that
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) absorption after oral administration is very low, and
systemic exposure is below 1%.

2.1.2 Biotransformation
Since calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) absorption is negligible, potential in
vivo metabolic transformation of the additive was not studied.
2.2

Toxicological studies

2.2.1 Short-term studies of toxicity
In a 28-day feeding study compliant with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines and Good Laboratory Practice
(GLP), calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was administered to Wistar rats (Weber &
Ramesh, 2005). Four groups, each consisting of six animals per sex, received the
test substance at target dose levels of 0, 500, 1500 or 4000 mg/kg bw per day via
the diet. Actually achieved doses were 0, 413, 1301 and 3495 mg/kg bw per day in
males and 0, 453, 1345 and 3609 mg/kg bw per day in females. The diet was
prepared once weekly and offered to the animals ad libitum. Dietary concentrations
were adjusted each week based on body weights and food consumption. Analytical
results showed that calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was stable in the diet and
distributed homogeneously. Animals were observed for morbidity and mortality
twice daily and for clinical signs once daily. Detailed clinical examination, body
weights and food consumption were determined weekly. An ophthalmoscopic
examination was carried out before treatment and near scheduled termination.
Blood smears for differential leukocyte count were obtained from the tail on the day
prior to sacrifice; blood for clinical chemistry was obtained at scheduled termination
from the abdominal aorta after overnight fasting. All animals were subjected to a
detailed gross necropsy. Liver, kidneys, adrenals, gonads, epididymides, thymus,
spleen, brain and heart were weighed. These tissues plus other tissues as specified
by OECD guidelines were preserved for histological evaluation. Tissues of the
control and high-dose groups were subjected to histopathological examination. The
recta of low-and mid-dose males were also examined.

20

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

All animals survived without any clinical signs until scheduled sacrifice.
Ophthalmoscopic examination did not reveal any abnormalities in the eyes of
experimental animals. Group mean body weights and body weight gains of treated
groups were comparable with those of controls. There was no effect of treatment
on food consumption. Statistically significant changes in clinical chemistry
parameters are not considered to be biologically relevant because values either
were within the laboratory historical control data or were observed without a dose–
response relationship. There were no relevant changes in absolute or relative
organ weights; changes in the females’ absolute and relative organ weights were
without a dose–response relationship and within the historical control background
range. Pathological findings were those expected for animals of this strain and
age. The only toxicologically relevant histopathological finding was a chronic
inflammation of the rectum of the high-dose males (4/6), which was not observed
in the control, low-dose or mid-dose group. Chronic inflammation was of minimal
severity. The lesion consisted of minimal fibrosis with a few inflammatory cell
infiltrates. Based on the chronic inflammation observed in the high-dose males, the
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of this study is considered to be the
mid-dose level of 1301 mg/kg bw per day for males and 1345 mg/kg bw per day for
females.
As part of a toxicological study for a new feed additive formulated with
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) as carrier, rats were treated not only with the additive
in question but also with a placebo containing the same amount of calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) but not the additive (Wolz et al., 2004). In this study, groups
of Wistar rats (five per sex per group) were treated as follows: control, placebo
control, 100, 500 and 1000 mg of test item/kg bw per day. The placebo contained
839.4 g calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)/kg and was mixed into the animals’ diet at
a concentration of 84 700 mg/kg, resulting in calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) intakes
of 5.4–6.4 g/kg bw per day by males and 5.8–6.9 g/kg bw per day by females.
Clinical signs, food consumption and body weights were monitored periodically
throughout the study. At the end of the treatment period, blood samples for
haematology and clinical chemistry were taken. All animals were killed, necropsied
and examined postmortem. Histological examinations were performed on organs
and tissues from the control and high-dose groups.
All animals survived. Clinical signs in the placebo control group consisted of
dark faecal discoloration in all animals from treatment week 1 until the end of the
study. This was accompanied by soft faeces in all animals of the placebo control
group throughout the study. These findings were considered to be the typical
secondary effects of the high dietary calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) content and of
no toxicological relevance. Food consumption, body weights, clinical pathology and
organ weights of all groups were comparable with those of the control group. In the
high-dose test item group, there were no relevant histological findings. Thus, a
dietary intake of 6.4 g calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)/kg bw per day for 28 days was
without any findings under the conditions of the study.
A 90-day feeding study was conducted in compliance with GLP and following
internationally accepted guidelines (Thiel et al., 2007). Calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) was fed to Wistar rats for 90 days at target dose levels of 0, 500, 1000 or

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

21

2000 mg/kg bw per day (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Each group was divided
into subgroups: allocation A of groups 1–4 consisted of 20 animals per sex per group
and was treated for 90 days (main animals). Groups 1 and 4 had additional recovery
animals that were kept for an additional 28 days without treatment (10 animals per
sex per group; allocation B). Allocation C of groups 1–4 consisted of six satellite
animals per sex per group and was used for investigation of changes in primary
immune response using the sheep red blood cell assay (functional testing of
immune response). In addition, the distribution of the leukocyte subpopulation was
studied after 13 and 17 weeks in allocation B animals using flow cytometry. The diet
was prepared once weekly and offered to the animals ad libitum. Dietary
concentrations were adjusted each week based on body weights and food
consumption. The diet was analysed for accuracy, homogeneity and stability;
analytical results showed that the diets were accurately prepared and that calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) was stable in the diet and distributed homogeneously.
Animals were observed for moribundity and mortality twice daily and for clinical
signs once daily. During weeks 13 and 17, animals were subjected to a functional
observational battery using a modified Irwin screen. Hindlimb and forelimb grip
strength as well as locomotor activity were determined. Body weights and food
consumption were determined weekly. An ophthalmoscopic examination was
carried out before treatment, near scheduled termination and after the recovery
period. Detailed haematological and clinical laboratory examinations were
performed after 2, 6, 13 and 17 weeks using blood from the retro-orbital plexus. At
the same time points, urinalysis was performed and faecal pH was measured.
Sperm count, motility and morphology were assessed after 13 and 17 weeks. Sperm
samples used for motility measurements were obtained from the left caudal
epididymides of the animals. For assessment of sperm motility, 100 sperm were
counted. Morphology was determined after fixation; 500 sperm were
microscopically evaluated. Sperm and spermatid counts were determined in the left
caudal epididymides and left testis after homogenization by manual counting. The
estrous cycle was investigated during weeks 10–12 and 15–16. All animals were
subjected to a detailed gross necropsy after termination. Liver, kidneys, adrenals,
gonads, testes, epididymides, thymus, spleen, brain, thyroid/parathyroid, ovaries,
uterus and heart were weighed. These tissues plus others specified in the OECD
guidelines were preserved for histopathological examination. The control and highdose groups were subjected to histopathological examination. Based on the chronic
inflammation of the rectum seen in the high-dose animals in the 4-week feeding
study (Weber & Ramesh, 2005), the rectum of all animals was subjected to
histopathological investigation. Additionally, the mesenteric lymph nodes and the
kidneys of the low- and mid-dose groups were evaluated by histopathology because
of changes observed in the respective organs of the high-dose animals.
Target dose levels were achieved. Males consumed í0.8%, í0.6% and
í1.13% of the target dose levels of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw per day,
respectively. Females consumed +1.3%, +1.8% and +2.0% of the target dose levels
of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw per day, respectively. Two males were prematurely
sacrificed (low- and mid-dose groups) for ethical reasons. One animal had an
intestinal intussusception as revealed at necropsy, and the other had a markedly
enlarged eye; both events were not considered to be treatment related. Other

22

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

clinical signs were not observed. The functional observational battery revealed that
the only significant changes observed were in forelimb grip strength in the high-dose
group of males and the hindlimb grip strength of the mid-dose group of females;
after recovery, no differences from controls were observed, and the findings were
not considered to be toxicologically relevant. Locomotor activity was statistically
significantly reduced transiently in all dose groups after 13 weeks. During the
recovery period, slight changes were noted transiently in the high-dose animals of
both sexes. Owing to their transient nature, these findings were not considered to
be of relevance. No test item–related ophthalmoscopic findings of toxicological
relevance were noted. Faecal pH was not affected. Relevant changes during
evaluation of sperm parameters were not noted. Estrous cycles of treated females
were comparable with those of control females. Also, food consumption, body
weights and body weight gain were comparable with those of controls. There were
several differences between treatment groups and controls in clinical laboratory
investigations. However, all of them were of a transient nature, not dose related, not
observed after the recovery period and within the range of historical control data.
The primary immune response of the treated animals as well as the leukocyte
population were comparable with those of controls.
Toxicologically relevant changes in absolute or relative organ weights were
not observed. At the end of the treatment and recovery periods, no test item–related
gross lesions were recorded. Histopathological examination of the rectum showed
neither inflammation nor irritation. The finding that distinguished treated animals
from controls was the presence of large focal/multifocal aggregates of foamy
histiocytes in the mesenteric lymph nodes in all treatment groups following a dose–
response relationship. This finding showed minimal regression after the recovery
period (Table 2). No concomitant tissue damage was observed. Therefore, this
finding was not considered to be adverse. Moreover, there was no evidence of
histiocytosis in other lymphoreticular tissues. Tubular vacuolation of the kidney was
also noted after the treatment and recovery periods in both sexes of the mid- and
high-dose groups (see Table 2). The finding showed no dose–response relationship
in severity, and there was no tubular damage or impact on renal function, further
supported by the lack of effect on clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters.
Therefore, this finding was considered not adverse, and no dose-dependent
increase in severity of the lesion was reported.
The authors concluded that dietary administration of calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) for 13 weeks to Wistar rats produced no adverse effects up to and including
the highest administered dose level. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) in this study is the target dose of 2000 mg/kg bw per
day, which corresponds to 1978 mg/kg bw per day for males and 2040 mg/kg bw
per day for females.
2.2.2 Genotoxicity
The genotoxic potential of calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was assessed in
a reverse mutation test in two bacterial species (including metabolic activation)
and in the test for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster cells (for details,
see Table 3). Calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) did not induce reverse mutation in
bacteria, and no indication of clastogenicity in mammalian cells was found.

In light of the absence of mutagenicity/genotoxicity in vitro and the lack of
systemic bioavailability after oral administration (see section 2.1.1), in vivo
genotoxicity testing with oral application was considered to be scientifically
unjustified. Since Loomis & Beyer (1953) had shown that intravenous injection of
lignosulfonate results in deaths due to respiratory failure, applying the substance in
such a test by another route was not considered feasible.
2.2.3 Reproductive toxicity
The possible maternal and developmental toxicities of calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) were investigated in female Wistar rats receiving target doses of 0, 100,
300 or 1000 mg/kg bw per day (22 animals per group) from day 6 post-coitum to
day 21 post-coitum (Thiel et al., 2006b). The dietary concentration was adjusted on
day 16 post-coitum to ensure intended dose levels. The diets with test item were

made available at the end of day 5 post-coitum to ensure sufficient exposure during
day 6 and at the end of day 15 post-coitum to ensure sufficient exposure during day
16. All females were examined twice daily for mortality and clinical signs. Body
weights were recorded daily from day 0 to day 21 post-coitum. Food consumption
was monitored at 3-day intervals. All females were sacrificed on day 21 post-coitum,
and the fetuses were removed by caesarean section. Females were necropsied,
and the uterus was weighed. The number of live and dead fetuses, position of
fetuses, number of corpora lutea, number of implantation sites and number of early
and late resorptions were recorded. Live fetuses were weighed, sexed and
examined for external anomalies. Fetuses were subjected to visceral and skeletal
examinations.
Owing to technical failure, fetuses from the mid-dose group (seven fetuses
in one litter) and high-dose group (27 fetuses in five litters) were damaged and not
available for visceral investigation. Thus, an additional control and high-dose group
were started, consisting of 22 females per group; in both additional groups, the full
set of investigations was performed.
The target doses were achieved in the control, low-dose, middle-dose and
high-dose groups, with mean values of 0, 101, 309 and 1007 mg/kg bw per day. In
the additional high-dose group, the effective dose was 971 mg/kg bw per day.
No deaths occurred. The treatment with the test item was well tolerated.
Neither test item–related clinical signs nor behavioural changes were noted
throughout the study. During the whole treatment period, food consumption and

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

body weight gain of the dose groups were similar to those of the control groups. At
scheduled necropsy, no test item–related findings were noted. The relevant
reproduction data (number of implantation sites, post-implantation loss, number of
live fetuses and number of embryo or fetal resorptions) from dose groups were
similar to those of the control.
The mean fetal weights were not considered to be influenced by treatment
with the test item, as observed changes were minimal and within the historical
control database. The sex ratio was comparable with that of controls. External
examination at caesarean section did not reveal any test item–related findings.
Visceral examination of bones and cartilage also revealed no test item–related
findings. Local thinning of the diaphragm was found in one fetus (one litter), three
fetuses (three litters), six fetuses (five litters) and seven fetuses (six litters) in the
control, low-dose, mid-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. In the additional
control and additional high-dose group, the incidences were three fetuses (three
litters) and six fetuses (four litters), respectively. The historical reference data for
this finding show an incidence of 0–8 occurrences. Thus, the finding of local thinning
of the diaphragm was considered to be within known background and not of
biological and toxicological relevance.
Under the conditions of this study, the oral treatment with the test item was
well tolerated in all dose groups. Mean food consumption and body weight
development of dams were similar in all groups. The relevant reproduction data, sex
ratios of fetuses and fetal weights were similar in all groups. There were no abnormal
embryo or fetal findings that were considered to be related to test item treatment.
The NOEL was at the high dose of 1000 mg/kg bw per day.
2.2.4 Special study on immune responses
After oral exposure of rats via the diet for 13 weeks (for study details, see
section 2.2.1), examination of total and differential white blood cell count as well as
determination of T-cell type distribution did not show any indication of different
distribution in comparison with control. Further, the primary immune response to
sheep red blood cells was comparable with control levels (Thiel et al., 2007).
2.2.5 Special study on skin sensitization
The potential of calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) to induce contact
hypersensitivity was investigated in mice using the local lymph node assay (van
Huygevoort, 2004). Groups of five animals each were epidermally exposed to 0,
2.5, 10 and 25% solutions of the test substance in propylene glycol on 3 consecutive
days. Three days after the last exposure, animals received injections with [3H]methyl
thymidine; 5 h later, they were sacrificed, lymph nodes were excised and
incorporated radioactivity in precipitated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was
determined. No skin irritation during induction was observed, and excised nodes
were normal. The stimulation index (SI) values for the substance at concentrations
of 2.5, 10 and 25% were 0.8, 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. There was no indication that
the compound could elicit SI values higher than 3, and it was concluded that the
compound should not be regarded as a skin sensitizer.

2.2.6 Studies on other lignosulfonate salts
Various salts of lignosulfonic acid have been used for many years as indirect
food additives—for example, as boiler water additives. Toxicity studies on these
older materials are difficult to interpret because of issues related to purity, heavy
metal content and the lack of information on molecular weight range. In general,
these materials display a somewhat different toxicity profile from that of calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65). Whereas calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) failed to produce
evidence of toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract, sodium lignosulfonate of unspecified
impurity was reported by R. Marcus & Watt (1974) and S.N. Marcus & Watt (1977)
to produce colonic ulceration in guinea-pigs and rabbits. Sodium lignosulfonate
(molecular weight 5000) was also reported by Keller (1978) to induce
gastrointestinal lesions in dogs and monkeys.
Sodium lignosulfonate has been reported to cause hypertrophy of the
mesenteric lymph nodes in dogs and monkeys (Keller, 1978) and congested
mesenteric lymph nodes in rats accompanied by pigmentation of macrophages
(Luscombe & Nicholls, 1973). Although a high incidence of histiocytosis was
reported in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats given calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65), the effects were not as severe as seen with older formulations of sodium
lignosulfonate, where hypertrophy and congestion were reported as well.
3.

DIETARY EXPOSURE

Some lignosulfonates are approved as feed additives in the European Union
(EU) and United States of America (USA), as adhesives in food packaging and as
dispersion and stabilizer agents in pesticide applications (Lignin Institute, 1997;
European Union, 2004); however, these are totally different materials from the
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) considered by the Committee and are not included
in this dietary exposure assessment.
The specific uses proposed for calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) are as a
carrier for vitamins and nutrient preparations, specifically the carotenoid nutrients
ȕ-carotene, zeaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, canthaxanthin and ȕ-apo-8ƍ-carotenal and
fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D and K when used in a powdered form only (i.e. not in
suspensions or emulsions) (DSM Nutritional Products, 2008). Encapsulation is the
most commonly used technique for nutrient preparations that are then suitable for
incorporation into processed foods and supplements. The amount added would be
limited for technological reasons—for example, saturation of colouring effects—or
by food regulations (permitted levels of addition of vitamins to food). Use will also
be limited by the ratio of the fat-soluble vitamins or carotenoids to carrier, proposed
to be in the range of 1:5 to 1:200, the ratio used depending on the individual fatsoluble vitamin or carotenoid (DSM Nutritional Products, 2008).
There were no poundage data available or data on current use levels of
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) in different food categories. Predictions of maximum
dietary exposure were derived by the manufacturer by assuming that the amount
of nutrient consumed was at the tolerable upper level of intake (UL) for the

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

27

fat-soluble vitamins1 or maximum predicted intakes for each carotenoid and
applying the relevant ratio of use of the individual fat-soluble vitamin or carotenoid
to the carrier (DSM Nutritional Products, 2008). Estimates of maximum dietary
exposure to various carotenoids submitted to previous meetings for lycopene
(Annex 1, reference 184), zeaxanthin (Annex 1, reference 173) and lutein (Annex 1,
reference 173) were used by the manufacturer for this purpose, in addition to
estimates of ȕ-carotene dietary exposures for the United Kingdom population
(Tennant et al., 2004).
Predicted maximum dietary exposures to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
from food and food supplements are summarized in Table 4 for each individual
nutrient and carotenoid.
Potential maximum levels of dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) when used as a carrier for carotenoids for food uses ranged up to 95 mg/
day or up to 2 mg/kg bw per day; and for use in supplements, from 5 to 125 mg/day
or up to 2 mg/kg bw per day, assuming a body weight of 60 kg. It was considered
unlikely that more than one carotenoid would be used in any one food; therefore,
total maximum dietary exposures would likely be at the upper end of the range
reported—i.e. 95 mg/day for food uses and 125 mg/day for use in supplements.
Dietary exposure data were not available for canthaxanthin or ȕ-apo-8ƍ-carotenal.
It was reported that canthaxanthin was used as a colour in only one specific food
and that ȕ-apo-8ƍ-carotenal had limited uses compared with lycopene and ȕcarotene (DSM Nutritional Products, 2008).
Estimates of potential dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
from use as a carrier for fat-soluble vitamins in food ranged from 1 to 10 mg/day for
vitamin D. There were no expected food uses for vitamin A, E or K. Estimates of
dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) from use as a carrier for fatsoluble vitamins in supplements ranged from 1 to 300 mg/day or 0.02–5 mg/kg bw
per day, assuming a body weight of 60 kg. The higher level of 500 mg/day for vitamin
K was related to the UL for vitamin K established in Japan rather than actual intakes,
which were not expected to exceed 10 mg/day. The highest potential dietary
exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) as a carrier for individual nutrients in
supplements was for supplements containing vitamin E at 300 mg/day, calculated
by applying the relevant ratio of use for vitamin E to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
to the UL for vitamin E. However, the manufacturers predict that maximum dietary
exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) in multivitamin supplements could reach
400 mg/day or 7 mg/kg bw per day, assuming they contain all four vitamins, A, D,
E and K, and assuming a body weight of 60 kg (DSM Nutritional Products, 2008).
In conclusion, the predicted maximum dietary exposure to calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) was 95 mg/day or 2 mg/kg bw per day as a carrier for
carotenoids in food, 125 mg/day or 2 mg/kg bw per day as a carrier for carotenoids

1

The UL for food and supplements is the highest level of a nutrient that is likely to pose no
adverse risk to almost all individuals for the population group. In this case, the highest UL
for each nutrient set for any population was used to predict potential dietary exposures to
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65).

28

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

in supplements and up to 400 mg/day or 7 mg/kg bw per day as a carrier for fatsoluble vitamins in supplements (assuming a body weight of 60 kg).
It is likely that potential dietary exposures to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
as a carrier for carotenoids or fat-soluble vitamins were overestimated, as use is
limited to only the powdered form of the individual carotenoid or fat-soluble vitamin
(50% of the total amount of carotenoids produced, 35–50% of the total amount of
fat-soluble vitamins produced), not all of these uses will be suitable for calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) as a carrier and there may be alternative carriers available.
For the reasons given above, mean dietary exposure to calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) would be very much lower than the predicted maximum
dietary exposure presented in Table 4 for consumers only in a population and lower
again for the whole population (consumers and non-consumers). However, the
maximum dietary exposure estimates do cover the situation where an individual
consumer may always choose to consume a product containing calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) at the maximum level on a daily basis.
The predicted maximum dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
through its proposed use as a carrier for fat-soluble vitamins and other nutrients in
processed foods appears to be low compared with that expected from lignin, the
parent compound, from normal human diets. Lignin is a natural constituent of many
plants and is a component of dietary fibre (defined by Tungland & Meyer, 2002;
DeVries, 2003). As estimated mean dietary intakes of lignin were 1–1.7 g/day from
diets in developed countries out of a total dietary fibre intake of 16–44 g/day
(Wenlock et al., 1984; Tungland & Meyer, 2002), the effect on total mean dietary
fibre intake from lignin-related substances by the proposed use of calcium
lignosulfonate (40–65) as a carrier is likely to be small.

COMMENTS

4.1

Toxicological data

33

Studies with tritiated calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) in rats indicated that
only limited absorption occurs after oral exposure. Owing to the constant formation
of tritiated water from the product, most (98.5%) of the radioactivity in blood, tissues
and urine co-eluted with tritiated water, indicating that only about 1% was present
in higher molecular weight fractions of the purified material used for dosing.
The toxicity of calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) has been studied in 28-day
and 90-day studies of oral toxicity in which calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was
incorporated into the diet. In the 28-day study of toxicity, groups of male and female
Wistar rats were given diets providing calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) at a target
daily dose of 0, 500, 1500 or 4000 mg/kg bw. The study was carried out in
accordance with OECD guidelines and involved complete pathological examination
of all major organs. With the exception of chronic inflammation of the rectum in
males at the highest dose, but not at the lowest or intermediate dose, no adverse
effects were observed. The NOAEL was equal to 1300 mg/kg bw per day for males
and 1350 mg/kg bw per day for females on the basis of the inflammatory response
in the rectum.
In a 90-day study that complied with GLP and with OECD guidelines, groups
of male and female Wistar rats were given diets providing calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) at a target dose of 0, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw per day. This study
involved complete pathological examination of all organs and tissues. No adverse
clinical or organ weight changes were reported. A functional observational battery
provided no evidence of adverse effects, and the results of a test for primary immune
response were normal. In this study, no histopathological changes were noted in
the rectum, but there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of histiocytosis
of the mesenteric lymph nodes in male and female rats. The magnitude of this effect
also increased with dose. The incidence and magnitude of this effect showed
minimal regression in a 28-day recovery study conducted in satellite groups of rats.
There was no evidence of histiocytosis in other lymphoreticular tissues. There was
also an increase in the incidence of tubular vacuolation of the kidney, but this was
not accompanied by a degenerative change and therefore was not considered to
be an adverse effect.
The finding of histiocytosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats treated with
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) has also been observed with other high molecular
weight, poorly absorbed materials, such as petroleum-derived mineral oils and
waxes and copovidone (a copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate) (Smith
et al., 1996; Mellert et al., 2004). Similar effects have also been observed with
polypentosan sulfate (National Toxicology Program, 2004). Histiocytosis appears
to be related to an attempt by the histiocytes of the mesenteric lymph nodes to
degrade the small amount of absorbed test article. Long-term studies in rats given
polypentosan sulfate and copovidone indicated that the histiocytosis does not
progress to any pathological lesion; thus, the Committee concluded that the
histiocytosis observed with calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) does not represent an
adverse effect. The NOEL in the 90-day study was therefore the target dose of
2000 mg/kg bw per day.

34

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

The genotoxicity of calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was evaluated in an
assay for mutation in S. typhimurium and E. coli, with and without metabolic
activation, and in a test for chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster cells. No
evidence of genotoxicity was found.
In a study of developmental toxicity, pregnant female Wistar rats were given
diets providing calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) at a target dose of 0, 100, 300 or
1000 mg/kg bw per day. No effects on the dams or fetuses were reported, and it
was concluded that the NOEL for reproductive effects was 1000 mg/kg bw per day.
The results of older studies with lignosulfonic acid salts of uncertain purity
and relative molecular mass are of limited relevance to the safety assessment of
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65).
4.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The amount of calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) added for use as a carrier of
carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins is expected to be limited for technological
reasons—for example, saturation of colouring effects—or by food regulations that
limit the level of addition of vitamins to food. Use will also be limited by the ratio of
the fat-soluble vitamins or carotenoids to carrier, proposed to be in the range from
1:5 to 1:200, the ratio used depending on the individual fat-soluble vitamin or
carotenoid.
There were no poundage data available or data on current use levels of
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) in different food categories. Predictions of maximum
dietary exposure were derived by the manufacturer by assuming that the amount
of nutrient consumed was at the UL for the fat-soluble vitamins or maximum
predicted intakes for each carotenoid and applying the relevant ratio of use of the
individual fat-soluble vitamin or carotenoid to the carrier.
Potential maximum levels of dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) when used as a carrier for carotenoids for food uses ranged up to 95 mg/
day or up to 2 mg/kg bw per day; and for use in supplements, from 5 to 125 mg/day
or up to 2 mg/kg bw per day, assuming a body weight of 60 kg. It was considered
unlikely that more than one carotenoid would be used in any one food; therefore,
total maximum dietary exposures would likely be at the upper end of the range
reported—i.e. 95 mg/day for food uses and 125 mg/day for use in supplements. It
was reported that canthaxanthin was used as a colour in only one specific food and
that ȕ-apo-8ƍ-carotenal had limited uses compared with lycopene and ȕ-carotene.
Estimates of potential dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
from use as a carrier for fat-soluble vitamins in food ranged from 1 to 10 mg/day for
vitamin D. There were no expected food uses for vitamin A, E or K. Estimates of
dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) from use as a carrier for fatsoluble vitamins in supplements ranged from 1 to 300 mg/day, or 0.02–5 mg/kg bw
per day, assuming a body weight of 60 kg. The higher level of 500 mg/day for vitamin
K was related to the UL for vitamin K established in Japan rather than actual intakes,
which were not expected to exceed 10 mg/day. The highest potential dietary
exposure for calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) as a carrier for individual nutrients in

CALCIUM LIGNOSULFONATE (40–65)

35

supplements was for supplements containing vitamin E at 300 mg/day, calculated
by applying the relevant ratio of use for vitamin E to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65)
to the UL for vitamin E. However, the manufacturers predict that maximum dietary
exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) in multivitamin supplements could reach
400 mg/day or 7 mg/kg bw per day, assuming they contain all four vitamins, A, D,
E and K, and assuming a body weight of 60 kg. It is likely that potential dietary
exposures to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) as a carrier for carotenoids or fatsoluble vitamins were overestimated, as use is limited to only the powdered form of
the individual fat-soluble vitamin or carotenoid (50% of the total amount of
carotenoids produced, 35–50% of the total amount of fat-soluble vitamins
produced), not all these uses will be suitable for calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) as
a carrier and there may be alternative carriers available.

EVALUATION

In a metabolic study in rats, calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was found to be
poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, owing to the limitations of
the study, it is difficult to determine the extent to which material of low molecular
weight may be absorbed.
The toxicity data on calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) consist of a 28-day and
a 90-day study of toxicity, negative results from a study of genotoxicity in vitro and
a study of developmental toxicity that showed no adverse effects in either dams or
fetuses. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in this study was 1000 mg/kg bw per
day, the highest dose tested. In the 28-day study, inflammation of the rectum was
observed, but this effect was not seen in the more extensive 90-day study. In the
90-day study, all the treated groups of animals displayed histiocytosis in the
mesenteric lymph nodes, and the incidence of this effect increased with increasing
dose. The histiocytosis seen in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats treated with
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) has been observed with other substances of high
molecular weight, such as polypentosan sulfate and copovidone (a copolymer of
vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate). Long-term studies with these substances in rats
indicated that the histiocytosis does not progress and is not associated with
carcinogenesis.
On the basis of the available data, the Committee concluded that the
histiocytosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes of rats fed calcium lignosulfonate
(40–65) is of no toxicological consequence; thus, the NOEL in the 90-day study is
the target dose of 2000 mg/kg bw per day. The Committee therefore established an
acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–20 mg/kg bw based on the NOEL of 2000 mg/kg
bw per day from the 90-day study and application of a safety factor of 100. The 100fold safety factor was considered by the Committee to be appropriate in the case of
calcium lignosulfonate (40–65), despite the absence of a long-term study, because
of its poor absorption, lack of toxicity in the 90-day study and lack of evidence for
developmental toxicity. In comparison with the ADI of 0–20 mg/kg bw, the maximum
potential dietary exposure to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was low and not
expected to exceed 7 mg/kg bw per day from use as a carrier of fat-soluble vitamins
and carotenoids in food and supplements.

EXPLANATION

This substance was placed on the agenda under the name “lauric arginate
ethyl ester”. The Committee decided that “ethyl lauroyl arginate” should be the name
- 39 -

40

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

under which it would be evaluated. Ethyl lauroyl arginate was evaluated by the
Committee at its present meeting at the request of the Codex Committee on Food
Additives at its Thirty-ninth Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007). The
Committee was asked to evaluate all data necessary for the assessment of the
safety, dietary intake and specifications of ethyl lauroyl arginate. The Committee
had not previously evaluated ethyl lauroyl arginate.
In 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established an
acceptable daily intake (ADI) for ethyl lauroyl arginate of 0.5 mg/kg body weight (bw)
per day (European Food Safety Authority, 2007). On 1 September 2005, the United
States Food and Drug Administration issued a letter indicating that it had no
questions regarding a Notice that ethyl lauroyl arginate is Generally Recognized as
Safe (GRAS) (GRAS Notice No. GRN 000164) for use as an antimicrobial agent at
concentrations of up to 225 mg/kg in the categories specified (United States Food
and Drug Administration, 2005).
The Committee received a submission containing unpublished information
on ethyl lauroyl arginate, including studies on NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and a commercial formulation containing 19.5% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate hydrochloride
(HCl) and 73% propylene glycol. Some of the results of these studies have been
published in the open literature. A search of the scientific literature was conducted,
but no additional information was identified.
1.1

Chemical and technical considerations

Ethyl lauroyl arginate is synthesized by first esterifying L-arginine with
ethanol to obtain ethyl arginate HCl, which is then reacted with lauroyl chloride to
form the active ingredient ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl. Ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl, which is present in the product in the range of 85–95%, is a cationic
surfactant that has a wide spectrum of activity against bacteria, yeasts and moulds.
NĮ-Lauroyl-L-arginine, a by-product in the manufacture of ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl, is also formed by enzymatic action in fresh food. The intended use of
ethyl lauroyl arginate is as a food preservative to prevent microbial growth and
spoilage in a range of foods and drinks, to be used at concentrations of up to
225 mg/kg.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Absorption, distribution and excretion
(a)

Rats

The plasma pharmacokinetics of ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 91.9% ethylNĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) and its by-product and metabolite, NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine,
were determined in Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD (SD)) rats with different oral (gavage)
dose and formulation conditions. All experiments were carried out in compliance
with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

41

and Development (OECD) guidelines. An initial pilot experiment was carried out at
a dose of 40 mg/kg bw formulated in propylene glycol/water with four male and four
female animals. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein post-dosing at 15, 30,
60, 90, 120 and 240 min. Based on the results from the pilot experiment, the
ethyl lauroyl arginate doses selected for the main experiment were 40, 120 and 320
mg/kg bw formulated in propylene glycol/water; and 120 mg/kg bw formulated in
either glycerol/water or water alone. There were four male animals in each of the
five treatment groups. Blood samples were taken from a tail vein post-dosing at 30,
60, 90, 120 and 240 min and at 8 h. All animals were sacrificed after completion of
the sampling procedure. Plasma concentrations of ethyl lauroyl arginate and NĮlauroyl-L-arginine were measured using a liquid chromatographic/tandem mass
spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method. The following pharmacokinetic parameters
were calculated using the computer program WinNonlin Pro version 5.0: maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax), plasma concentration at 8 h post-dosing (C8), areas
under the plasma concentration–time curve up to the last sample (AUCt) or up to
8 h post-dosing (AUC8), terminal rate constant (k) and terminal half-life (t½).
In the pilot experiment, plasma concentrations of ethyl lauroyl arginate were
mostly below the limit of quantification (<1 ng/ml), but Cmax occurred at 0.5–1.0 h
post-dosing for females (16.3 ± 18.7 ng/ml) and at 1.5 h post-dosing for males
(70 ng/ml, one animal only, concentrations in the other three animals were below
the limit of quantification). The Cmax of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine occurred at 1.0–1.5 h
after ethyl lauroyl arginate administration in both males (6.52 ± 0.7 ng/ml) and
females (18 ± 3.3 ng/ml). There were no noticeable differences between male and
female animals.
In the main experiment, plasma concentrations of ethyl lauroyl arginate
were generally close to or below the limit of quantification (<1 ng/ml) following
administration of the propylene glycol/water formulation at all three dose levels. The
mean Cmax and AUC8 values are summarized in Table 1.

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

The median time at which the Cmax of ethyl lauroyl arginate occurred
increased with increasing dose level, indicating a rapid absorption (0.5 h) at
40 mg/kg bw and a more prolonged absorption (3 h) at 320 mg/kg bw. Plasma
concentrations of ethyl lauroyl arginate were below the limit of quantification
by 8 h post-dosing in all animals at all dose levels. Plasma concentrations of
NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine at 8 h post-dosing were quantifiable in all animals at the 120
and 320 mg/kg bw dose levels. The rate of systemic exposure to ethyl lauroyl
arginate, as characterized by the Cmax ratios at each dose, was low and did not
increase consistently with increasing dose. The extent of systemic exposure to ethyl
lauroyl arginate, as characterized by the AUC8 ratios at each dose, could not be
estimated owing to the small number of quantifiable samples, which was ascribed
to the rapid hydrolysis of ethyl lauroyl arginate and NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine. The Cmax
and AUC8 ratios of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine increased by less than the proportionate
dose increment over the dose range 40–320 mg/kg bw. The authors concluded that
this suggested non-linear (dose-dependent) kinetics, as increasing the dose of ethyl
lauroyl arginate above 40 mg/kg bw resulted in a lower systemic exposure than
would be predicted from a linear relationship. Plasma concentrations of NĮ-lauroylL-arginine were considerably higher than those of ethyl lauroyl arginate, indicating
extensive conversion to NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine. The terminal rate constant and halflife could not be estimated from the available data for either ethyl lauroyl arginate
or NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine for any animal, except for NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine in one male
receiving 40 mg/kg bw, where k was 0.7123/h and t½ was 1 h.
The effect of the different formulations at a dose level of 120 mg/kg bw are
summarized in Table 2.

Absorption of ethyl lauroyl arginate was rapid, as indicated by the Cmax values
at 0.75–1 h. Plasma concentrations of ethyl lauroyl arginate were below the limit of
quantification (<1 ng/ml) by 8 h post-dosing in all animals for each formulation.
Plasma concentrations of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine at 8 h post-dosing were quantifiable
in all animals and were similar for each formulation. Systemic exposure to ethyl

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

43

lauroyl arginate, as indicated by Cmax, was similar following administration of the
glycerol/water and water formulations (approximately 10 ng/ml), but was considerably lower following administration of the propylene glycol/water formulation
(approximately 1 ng/ml). Cmax values for NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine were all similar, and
the difference between the propylene glycol/water formulation and the other two
formulations was much less marked. The authors considered that the differences
observed in the Cmax values for ethyl lauroyl arginate may not be of toxicological
significance for the following reasons:

• The extent (AUC8) of systemic exposure to ethyl lauroyl arginate exhibited the

•

same trend as the Cmax values. The AUC8 values for NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine were
generally all similar following administration of the three formulations (plasma
levels of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine give a better indication of the absorption of ethyl
lauroyl arginate).
Ethyl lauroyl arginate is very rapidly hydrolysed to NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine (even
prior to absorption), and the low plasma levels of ethyl lauroyl arginate detected
in this study are a consequence of this rapid metabolism. The higher plasma
levels of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine indicated absorption of ethyl lauroyl arginate/NĮlauroyl-L-arginine and show that absorption is similar for all three formulations.

The authors concluded that plasma levels of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, in
particular the AUC for NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, give a better indication of the absorption
of ethyl lauroyl arginate (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2005c).
As part of an investigation into the metabolism of ethyl lauroyl arginate, six
male Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD) BR) rats were administered a single oral
dose of [14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 89.4% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl;
200 mg/kg bw) by gavage, in compliance with GLP and OECD guidelines. At 0.5, 1
and 4 h after dosing, blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture (two rats for
each time point). Rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Concentrations of
radioactivity in the plasma increased from 14.2 μg/ml at 0.5 h to 118 μg/ml at 4 h
after dosing. The in vitro metabolism studies carried out as part of this study are
reported below in section 2.1.2 (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2001d).

Humans

In a preliminary clinical study conducted to GLP and in accordance with
OECD guidelines, two healthy male volunteers aged 20–30 years were administered [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 96% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) at an
oral dose of 5 mg/kg bw in propylene glycol/water. Blood samples were taken predosing and over a 24-h period following dosing. Plasma samples were analysed
for [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate, [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and [13C]arginine using
LC-MS/MS.
Plasma levels of [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate ranged from below the limit of
quantification (<1 ng/ml) to 44 ng/ml, those of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine ranged from
below the limit of quantification (<1 ng/ml) to 154 ng/ml and those of [13C]arginine
ranged from below the limit of quantification (<10 ng/ml) to 680 ng/ml. The authors
reported that ethyl lauroyl arginate was well tolerated except for a burning sensation

44

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

in the throat reported by both subjects and nausea reported by one. The authors
concluded that the burning sensation and possibly the nausea were due not to ethyl
lauroyl arginate but to the use of propylene glycol as the solvent (CentraLabS
Clinical Research Ltd, 2005a).
In the subsequent clinical study conducted to GLP and in accordance with
OECD guidelines, the plasma profile of [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 96% ethylNĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) was determined following administration of a single oral
dose to six healthy male volunteers (aged 18–55 years, mean 33.7 years). Two
subjects received a dose of 2.5 mg/kg bw, and the other four received a dose of
1.5 mg/kg bw, after an overnight fast followed by a standard breakfast. Blood
samples were taken from a forearm vein of each subject pre-dosing and over a
24-h period following dosing. Plasma samples were analysed for [13C]ethyl
lauroyl arginate, [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and [13C]arginine using LC-MS/MS. The
following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the computer program
WinNonlin Pro version 3.3: Cmax, AUCt, k and t½.
Plasma concentrations of [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate were below the limit of
quantification (<1 ng/ml) at all sampling times in all subjects, with the exception of
one male at the 2.5 mg/kg bw dose level, for whom concentrations of 1.34 and
1.45 ng/ml were measured at 10 and 15 min post-dosing, respectively. There were
therefore insufficient data to allow an assessment of the pharmacokinetics of
[13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-Larginine and [13C]arginine are summarized in Table 3.

The Cmax of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine generally occurred at 2 h post-dosing,
and the Cmax of [13C]arginine occurred earlier than or at the same time as for [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine. Assuming that ethyl lauroyl arginate and NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine
were broken down in the gastrointestinal tract, the authors suggested that the
absorption of [13C]arginine was more rapid than the absorption of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-

arginine. Plasma concentrations of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine were quantifiable up
to 12 h post-dosing, and those of [13C]arginine were quantifiable up to 4 or 8 h postdosing. Concentrations of [13C]arginine were generally higher than those of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, indicating extensive breakdown of ethyl lauroyl arginate and
NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine to arginine. The rate and extent of systemic exposure to both
[13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and [13C]arginine increased over the dose range, although
the Cmax and AUCt values at the highest dose level were approximately 20% lower
for [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and about 1.2-fold higher for [13C]arginine compared
with those values predicted from a linear relationship. The t½ of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-Larginine appeared to be independent of dose, and the t½ of [13C]arginine was similar
to that of [13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine. The authors concluded that there were
insufficient data to allow a meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate; however, pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for
[13C]NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and [13C]arginine (CentraLabS Clinical Research Ltd,
2005b).
2.1.2 Biotransformation
The biotransformation pathways of ethyl lauroyl arginate (Figure 1) have
been established from in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies (Huntingdon Life
Sciences Ltd, 2001d; Ruckman et al., 2004; European Food Safety Authority, 2007;
Laboratorios Miret S.A., 2008). Ethyl lauroyl arginate is rapidly hydrolysed by loss
of the lauroyl side-chain to form L-arginine ethyl ester and/or by cleavage of the
ethyl ester to form NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine. Further hydrolysis of either intermediate
results in the amino acid L-arginine. L-Arginine is further metabolized to ornithine
and urea. Ornithine can then be incorporated into endogenous compounds via the
urea and citric acid cycles and finally degraded to carbon dioxide. Both ethyl lauroyl
arginate and NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine have been shown to be rapidly metabolized to
arginine in rats and humans. EFSA concluded that, on ingestion by humans, ethyl
lauroyl arginate will be broken down to products of normal metabolism (European
Food Safety Authority, 2007). Based on the human data, which show higher plasma
concentrations of arginine than of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, it was suggested that the
majority of ethyl lauroyl arginate is metabolized prior to absorption (Hawkins, 2005).
(a)

In vivo

[14C]Ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, >97% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) was
administered orally via gavage at a dose of 180 mg/kg bw to four male SpragueDawley rats in compliance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Urine and expired air
were collected at 0–8 h, at 8–24 h and at 24-h intervals, up to 5 days after dosing.
Faeces were collected at 24-h intervals up to 5 days after dosing. At 5 days postdosing, animals were sacrificed, and the gastrointestinal tract, including contents,
liver and carcass were removed for analysis. Radioactivity was measured by liquid
scintillation counting.
During the 5 days following dosing, 36.6 ± 5.4% (mean ± standard deviation)
of the dose was excreted as carbon dioxide in the expired air, 11.8 ± 0.9%
was excreted in the urine, 4.3 ± 1.2% was excreted in the faeces, 0.5 ± 0.3%
was recovered from the cage washout and 46.4 ± 6.7% was retained in the

carcass, including 3.4 ± 0.4% in the liver. The low rate of excretion in the faeces
indicated that ethyl lauroyl arginate–derived material was almost completely
absorbed. Analysis of the urine (0–24 h) showed that the major metabolite cochromatographed with urea, although the identity of this metabolite was not
confirmed. This metabolite represented a mean of 7.7% of the dose in urine. Six
other radioactive components were detected in the urine, all of which represented
0.2% of the dose.
The authors concluded that ethyl lauroyl arginate was rapidly metabolized
to the amino acid arginine, which then underwent normal amino acid catabolism,

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

resulting in urea and carbon dioxide. The high level of retention of radioactivity in
the carcass up to 5 days after dosing was concluded to be due to the formation of
other radiolabelled amino acids of the urea cycle, which would be subsequently
incorporated into endogenous products (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1998g).
Six male rats were administered an oral dose of ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity,
93.2% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) at 200 mg/kg bw in a study conducted in
compliance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Arginine accounted for 48% of the total
radioactivity in the plasma, with lesser amounts of ornithine (7.7%), ethyl lauroyl
arginate (<10%) and an unidentified polar fraction (17%) (Huntingdon Life Sciences
Ltd, 2001d).
(b)

In vitro

The biotransformation pathway of ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 93.2% ethylNĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) was investigated in a series of in vitro experiments
conducted to GLP and in accordance with OECD guidelines. Aliquots of plasma and
liver S9 fractions from an untreated male Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD) BR) rat
were incubated with [14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate at a nominal concentration of
10 μg/ml and then analysed by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and liquid scintillation counting.
Following incubation of S9 liver preparations with [14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate,
the two major radioactive components were identified as unchanged ethyl lauroyl
arginate and ornithine. Also identified were NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, arginine ethyl
ester, arginine and urea. Four hours after treatment of the S9 fractions, more than
50% of [14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate had been metabolized; by 24 h, only 25%
[14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate was detected. The major metabolite identified was
ornithine (29.3% at 24 h after treatment). Analysis of the plasma extracts showed
profiles similar to those seen in the S9 liver fractions, presumed to result from
esterase activity. Analysis confirmed the four major radioactive components to be
unchanged ethyl lauroyl arginate, NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, arginine (the major
metabolite) and ornithine. No arginine ethyl ester was detected in the plasma
extracts; therefore, this metabolite was concluded to be the result of a minor
metabolic pathway. The authors concluded that ethyl lauroyl arginate is rapidly
metabolized by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester and lauroyl amide to arginine, which
subsequently enters the urea cycle, where it is hydrolysed to ornithine and urea.
They therefore concluded that exposure to ethyl lauroyl arginate and NĮ-lauroyl-Larginine is likely to be very short (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2001d).
The stability of ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 95.6% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl) was determined in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, in human
plasma and in a preparation of human hepatocytes. All experiments were carried
out in compliance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Simulated gastric fluids were
prepared in the presence and absence of pepsin, and simulated intestinal fluids (at
pH 6.8 and 7.5) were prepared in the presence and absence of pancreatin. The
simulated fluids were incubated with [14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate at 0.25 mg/ml
(gastric and intestinal fluids) or 10 μg/ml (plasma and hepatocytes). Samples were
taken at 0 (immediately after treatment), 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and (for intestinal fluids

48

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

only) 240 min after treatment with [14C]ethyl lauroyl arginate. Human plasma
samples and cryopreserved hepatocytes were incubated with [14C]ethyl lauroyl
arginate for up to 4 h and 3 h, respectively. All samples were analysed by HPLC to
determine the proportions of ethyl lauroyl arginate and any degradation products.
Ethyl lauroyl arginate was stable in simulated gastric fluid with or without
pepsin, over a period of 2 h, representing at least 96.1% of the sample radioactivity.
In simulated intestinal fluids containing pancreatin (at both pH 6.8 and 7.5), ethyl
lauroyl arginate was immediately degraded to NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, which was
subsequently degraded to arginine. At zero time, NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and arginine
represented 95.2–98.2% and 1.8–4.8% of the sample of radioactivity, respectively.
After 240 min, these proportions were reversed, and ethyl lauroyl arginate was not
detected in any of these samples. In the absence of pancreatin, ethyl lauroyl
arginate was stable at all time points at pH 7.5 and up to 30 min at pH 6.8, after
which it started to degrade to NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine. In human plasma and
hepatocytes, ethyl lauroyl arginate degraded to NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine over the
course of the incubation period. Radioactivity levels decreased from 98.4% at zero
time to 51.3% at 4 h (plasma) and from 75.7% at zero time to 6.1% at 3 h
(hepatocytes). Arginine was not detected in these samples (Huntingdon Life
Sciences Ltd, 2003a).

2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
(a)

Ethyl lauroyl arginate

Groups of five male and five female Han Wistar rats were given diets
containing ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 89.4% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) at
concentrations of 0, 25 000, 37 500 or 50 000 mg/kg diet (equal to 0, 2353, 3438
and 4273 mg/kg bw per day for males; and 0, 2379, 3329 and 4641 mg/kg bw per
day for females) for 4 weeks continuously. This was a preliminary toxicity study,
conducted in accordance with GLP and OECD guidelines, to determine acceptable
dosages for a 13-week dietary study. Animals were inspected at least twice daily
throughout the study. Body weights were recorded prior to dosing, at the end of
week 1, twice weekly for weeks 2–4 and before a detailed necropsy. Mean weekly
food consumption for each animal was calculated, as well as mean food conversion
efficiencies for each treatment group. Just prior to necropsy, blood samples were
taken from the retro-orbital sinus, and an extensive range of haematological and
blood chemistry tests were performed. A wide range of organs and tissues were

collected for weight measurement and retained for possible histopathological
examination.
There were no deaths. Body weight gain, food consumption and food
conversion efficiencies were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in all treated
animals during week 1, particularly in high-dose animals. During the remaining
period (weeks 2–4), body weight gain and food conversion efficiencies were similar
to or greater than those of the controls, although food consumption remained low
for treated animals. Haematological investigations just before necropsy revealed
marginal differences from controls in females receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet; these
changes comprised slightly higher haemoglobin concentration and mean cell
haemoglobin and volume. Blood chemistry findings indicated slight effects in the
liver, comprising lower total protein, albumin and calcium concentrations for males
receiving 37 500 and 50 000 mg/kg diet. Females receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet had
higher blood enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase
and aspartate aminotransferase). Females receiving 37 500 mg/kg diet had slightly
higher aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities. Liver
weights and macroscopic appearance did not differ from those of controls. Analysis
of other organ weights and macroscopic examination did not reveal any findings
related to treatment. The highest dietary concentration of 50 000 mg ethyl lauroyl
arginate/kg was considered acceptable for the subsequent 13-week study
(Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2000c).
In the 13-week study, groups of 20 male and 20 female Han Wistar rats were
administered ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 90.1% and 93.2% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl [two batches]) in the diet at concentrations of 0, 5000, 15 000 or

50

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

50 000 mg/kg diet (equal to 0, 384, 1143 and 3714 mg/kg bw per day for males; and
0, 445, 1286 and 3915 mg/kg bw per day for females) continuously. The study was
conducted in accordance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Animals were inspected
at least twice daily throughout the study. Body weights were recorded on the day
that treatment commenced and then weekly throughout the remainder of the
treatment period. Mean weekly food consumption for each animal was calculated,
as well as mean food conversion efficiencies for each treatment group. A number
of functional observations were performed at various times throughout the study.
Just prior to necropsy, blood samples were taken from the retro-orbital sinus, and
an extensive range of haematological and blood chemistry tests were performed.
During the final week of treatment, urine was collected for urinalysis and
microscopy; and the eyes of 10 males and 10 females from each group were
examined. A wide range of organs and tissues were collected for weight
measurement and histopathology at necropsy.
There were no deaths. There was evidence of mild toxicity during the in-life
assessments of animals receiving 15 000 and 50 000 mg/kg diet, observed as
effects on appearance (ungroomed coat and brown staining on the muzzle),
reduced body weight gains and reduced food consumption and food conversion
efficiencies. During the 1st week of treatment, animals receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet
had a marked loss of body weight (–16% and –13% for males and females,
respectively). Body weight gain was also significantly lower in animals receiving
15 000 mg/kg diet and males receiving 5000 mg/kg diet. Overall, the body weights
of animals receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet and of males receiving 15 000 mg/kg diet
did not fully recover by the end of the treatment period. During week 1, food
consumption was markedly lower for animals receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet (33% and
39% of that of the controls for males and females, respectively). Food consumption
for animals receiving 15 000 mg/kg diet and males receiving 5000 mg/kg diet was
also slightly lower than that of the controls. Food consumption remained low during
the remainder of the study in animals receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet (overall, 79% and
78% of control values for males and females, respectively). Food conversion
efficiencies were incalculable during the 1st week of treatment for animals receiving
50 000 mg/kg diet because of the body weight losses; thereafter, food conversion
efficiency was slightly higher than or similar to that of the controls. The battery of
functional observations revealed no evidence of neurotoxicity. There were no
treatment-related ophthalmological findings. Minor changes were observed in
haematological parameters of males receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet (slightly higher
mean cell haemoglobin, mean cell haemoglobin concentration and mean cell
volume, and slightly lower total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts compared
with controls). These changes were not evident in females. Blood chemistry
investigations revealed lower total protein and albumin concentrations,
predominantly for animals receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet. Slightly lower cholesterol
concentrations were also apparent for females receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet. Such
findings are indicative of an effect on the liver. However, in the absence of any effect
on liver weight or findings at macroscopic examination, these changes were
considered by the authors to be of doubtful toxicological significance. Urinalysis
revealed a low pH in males receiving 15 000 and 50 000 mg/kg diet. Macroscopic
examination did not reveal any treatment-related findings, nor were there any organ

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

51

weight changes attributable to treatment. The only histopathological findings that
were considered to be related to treatment were in the stomach (in the area adjacent
to the entry of the oesophagus) of animals receiving 15 000 and 50 000 mg/kg diet.
The predominant change was parakeratosis; ulceration, erosions and epithelial
hyperplasia were also seen to a lesser degree. The authors suggested that these
findings indicated an irritant action of ethyl lauroyl arginate on the mucosal tissue
and concluded that the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 5000 mg
ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg diet (equal to 384 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day)
(Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2001c).
The irritation observed in the forestomachs was localized and was
considered not to be indicative of direct systemic toxicity (Laboratorios Miret S.A.,
2008). Furthermore, the irritant action of ethyl lauroyl arginate was considered by a
consultant haematologist (commissioned by Laboratorios Miret S.A. for Huntingdon
Life Sciences Ltd, where the study was performed) to correlate with the reduction
in white cells. The reduction of mature white cells in the peripheral blood was
reported to be the result of a normal response to the changes induced in the stomach
lining, resulting in migration of white blood cells into the tissues (Brown, 2008).
(b)

Commercial formulation

Similar studies conducted to GLP and in accordance with OECD guidelines
were performed with a commercial product proposed for use as a preservative in
food, containing 19.5% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl in a propylene glycol/water
(73%/27%) formulation. Groups of five male and five female Crl:CD BR rats were
given diets containing the commercial material at concentrations of 0, 3200, 12 800
or 50 000 mg/kg (equal to 0, 336, 1393 and 5269 mg/kg bw per day for males; and
0, 352, 1400 and 5846 mg/kg bw per day for females) continuously for 4 weeks.
Correcting for the fact that the test formulation contained only 19.5% of the active
ingredient, these doses were equal to ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl doses of 0,
66, 272 and 1027 mg/kg bw per day for males and 0, 69, 275 and 1140 mg/kg bw
per day for females. This was a preliminary toxicity study to determine acceptable
dosages for a 13-week dietary study. During the treatment period, clinical signs,
body weight, and food and water consumption were recorded. During week 4, blood
samples were taken from the orbital sinus, and an extensive range of
haematological and blood chemistry tests were performed. Animals were subjected
to a detailed necropsy, including postmortem examination, organ weight analysis
and histopathology.
There were no mortalities or treatment-related findings at any dose level.
The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was therefore reported to be 50 000 mg/kg
diet, and it was concluded that that concentration was acceptable for a subsequent
13-week dietary study of the formulation (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1995).
In the 13-week study, groups of 10 male and 10 female Crl:CD(SD) BR rats
were administered the formulation at the same dietary concentrations. Correcting
for the fact that the test formulation contained only 19.5% of the active ingredient,
the doses of ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl were equal to 0, 43, 175 and 645 mg/
kg bw per day for males; and 0, 51, 208 and 766 mg/kg bw per day for females.

52

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

During the treatment period, clinical signs, body weight, and food and water
consumption were recorded, and food conversion ratios were calculated. During
week 13, blood samples were taken from the orbital sinus, and an extensive range
of haematological and blood chemistry tests were performed. Also during week 13,
the eyes of all the animals in the control and high-dose groups were examined, and
urine was also collected for urinalysis and microscopy. Animals were subjected to
a detailed necropsy, including organ weight analysis and histopathology.
There were no treatment-related clinical signs observed during the study.
There was one unscheduled death in a control male during week 1. No clinical signs
had been noted for this animal, and the cause of death was determined to be a
ruptured liver. The mean body weight gains for the female rats were significantly
reduced (88%, 79% and 86% of control values for the three doses, respectively).
There was no effect on male body weight, and so the effect on females was
considered by the authors to be of uncertain relationship to treatment. Mean
cumulative food consumption was unaffected by treatment in any of the treatment
groups. Females had slightly lower food utilization efficiencies, with no dose–
response relationship. Group mean water intakes were generally comparable with
those of controls, apart from males receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet, which had a slightly
higher water consumption (117% of that of the controls). There were no ocular
lesions considered to be attributable to treatment. There was a slightly lower total
white blood cell count among males and females receiving 12 800 and 50 000 mg/
kg diet compared with controls, although there was no consistency in the type of
white blood cell affected, and significance was attained only for females (76% and
72% of that of the controls for the 12 800 and 50 000 mg/kg diet groups,
respectively). There were no treatment-related biochemical changes. Males
receiving 50 000 mg/kg diet had a slightly higher urine volume compared with
controls, consistent with the increase in water intake. Females receiving 50 000 mg/
kg diet had a slightly higher group mean relative liver weight compared with controls,
although no microscopic changes were observed. At necropsy, an increased
incidence of alopecia was noted among females receiving 12 800 and 50 000 mg/
kg diet, although this was considered of uncertain biological significance. Minor nonsignificant changes (dilation, local inflammation, nodules) were observed
macroscopically in the forestomach lining of animals receiving 12 800 and 50 000
mg/kg diet. No other treatment-related changes were observed macroscopically or
microscopically. The authors concluded that the no-effect level for the formulation
was likely to be 12 800 mg/kg diet (equal to 175 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/
kg bw per day) (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1996).
A review of this study by a consultant haematologist (commissioned by
Laboratorios Miret S.A. for Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, where the study was
performed) suggested that although a slight reduction in white blood cell count
occurred with only minor visible damage to the stomach lining, such an effect is not
uncommon in toxicological studies. The results suggested pre-ulcerative or preirritation changes that, owing to the nature of the formulation, had not progressed
to positive damage, although they had been detected by the white blood cells owing
to their sensitivity. The reduction of mature white blood cells in the peripheral blood
was reported to be the result of a normal response to the changes induced in the

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

53

stomach lining, resulting in migration of white blood cells into the tissues (Brown,
2008).
2.2.3 Long-term studies of toxicity
In a 52-week study conducted to GLP and in accordance with OECD
guidelines, three groups of 20 male and 20 female Crl:CD(SD)IGS BR rats were
given diets containing ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 88.2% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl) at concentrations of 0, 2000, 6000 or 18 000 mg/kg diet (equal to 0,
106, 307 and 907 mg/kg bw per day for males; and 0, 131, 393 and 1128 mg/kg bw
per day for females) continuously. During the study, animals were inspected for
clinical condition, and body weight and food consumption were recorded. Prior to
commencement and during each week of treatment, the animals were assessed for
physical condition and behaviour; during week 49 of treatment, sensory reactivity,
grip strength and motor activity assessments were performed on 10 males and
10 females from each group. Ophthalmic examinations of all animals in the control
and top-dose groups were carried out before treatment and during week 51. During
weeks 14, 26 and 52, blood samples were taken from the retro-orbital sinus of
10 males and 10 females from each group for analysis of an extensive range of
haematological and blood chemistry parameters. Additional blood samples were
also withdrawn from 18 males and 18 females in each treatment group for
toxicokinetic and bioanalytical investigations. During weeks 12, 25 and 51, urine
samples were collected from all animals for urinalysis. At the end of the treatment
period, all animals were subjected to a detailed necropsy. Bone marrow samples
were taken from the tibia during necropsy and smears prepared for a full myelogram.
A full macroscopic examination was performed, and weights of adrenals, brain,
kidneys, liver, ovaries and testes were recorded. An extensive range of tissue
samples were collected for microscopic examination.
There were six unscheduled deaths during the study, considered by the
authors not to be attributable to treatment: one control male, two males and one
female in the 2000 mg/kg diet dose group, and one male and one female in the
18 000 mg/kg diet dose group. Females in the 18 000 mg/kg diet dose group and,
to a lesser extent, in the 6000 mg/kg diet dose group showed higher weekly
incidences of brown fur staining and ungroomed coats, compared with the controls,
during the period from week 1 to week 13. By week 14, no clear difference between
groups was observed. At 6000 and 18 000 mg/kg diet, both males and females
showed low body weight gain compared with controls throughout the treatment
period, but particularly so during the first 3 weeks (in week 1, animals treated with
18 000 mg/kg diet showed gains that were less than 50% of the control values).
Food consumption was reduced in both males and females at 18 000 mg/kg diet
throughout the treatment period (particularly in week 1, when consumption was 69%
and 76%, respectively, of that of controls); and in males at 6000 mg/kg diet
throughout the treatment period. Reduced food conversion efficiency was observed
in both males and females at 6000 and 18 000 mg/kg diet, during the 1st week of
treatment only. The authors attributed the lower weight gains to a lower food intake.
The only effect noted in the neurobehavioural screening was higher total high- and
low-beam motor activity scores for males receiving 18 000 mg/kg diet, compared

54

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

with controls. There were no treatment-related ocular changes. Toxicokinetic
analyses indicated linear kinetics across the doses and revealed no differences in
the systemic exposure of male and female rats to ethyl lauroyl arginate or NĮ-lauroylL-arginine. Maximum mean plasma concentrations occurred overnight,
suggesting nocturnal feeding. During week 52, the rate and extent of systemic
exposure of rats to ethyl lauroyl arginate and NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine increased
proportionately with increasing dose (linear kinetics) over the concentration range
6000–18 000 mg/kg diet.
There were no clear effects of treatment on the bone marrow. The
differences observed from controls were a reduced proerythrocyte count in top-dose
males and a reduced internormoblast count in all treated females (not dose related).
These effects were considered by the authors not to be associated with treatment,
as they were minor, not dose related or inconsistent across the sexes. There were
treatment-related effects on white blood cell parameters for both sexes. At week 14,
treated females showed a reduced neutrophil count at 18 000 mg/kg diet, and both
sexes showed a dose-related reduction in monocytes at 6000 and 18 000 mg/kg
diet. At week 26, treated males and females showed a reduction in total white blood
cell counts, although the effect was not dose related in males (white blood cell
counts amounted to 78%, 86% and 74% of control values for males in the three
dose groups, respectively; and 91%, 72% and 65% of control values for females in
the three dose groups, respectively). In males, this was mainly due to a reduced
lymphocyte count (significant at all three doses but not dose related). Also observed
in males were reduced basophil and monocyte counts at 18 000 mg/kg diet. In
females, the reduced total white blood cell count was mainly due to a reduced
neutrophil count at 18 000 mg/kg diet and a reduced lymphocyte count at 6000 and
18 000 mg/kg diet (not dose related). Also observed in females were reduced
basophil (18 000 mg/kg diet) and monocyte (dose related at all three doses) counts.
At week 52, only high-dose males showed lower than control total white blood cell
counts (76% of that of controls), owing to a reduced neutrophil count. In the absence
of a clear dose-related trend and treatment-related effects on the bone marrow,
together with the lack of any histopathology of the lymphoid tissues, the authors
considered that the white blood cell effects were not of toxicological importance.
There were no effects of treatment on the red blood cell or clotting parameters
throughout the study; the only noteworthy effect on blood chemistry was higher
group mean urea values for all treated females at week 52, with significance at the
top dose. Urinalysis revealed no effects of treatment, and there were no effects of
treatment on organ weights.
In the 18 000 mg/kg diet group (and, to a lesser degree, in the 6000 and
2000 mg/kg diet groups), more macroscopic depressions on the epithelial aspect
of the forestomach (in the oesophageal groove) were observed in males and
females, compared with controls. Histopathology of the non-glandular epithelium of
the forestomach revealed erosion (one female at 18 000 mg/kg diet); ulceration
(females in all groups and males treated with 6000 mg/kg diet); re-epithelialization
(females in all groups and males treated with 6000 and 18 000 mg/kg diet); and
hyperplasia (males in all treatment groups and females in all groups). The lesions
were accompanied by subepithelial/submucosal inflammation and subepithelial

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

55

fibrosis and inflammation of the non-glandular epithelium and reflected the
depressions noted in the forestomach at necropsy. The observations were
significantly different from control only in the group treated with 18 000 mg/kg diet.
The authors considered that these changes represented a local response to
irritation and thus were not indicative of direct systemic toxicity. No other changes
were observed in the non-glandular region of the forestomach, and there were no
changes in the glandular region. There were no treatment-related effects on organ
weights. The authors concluded that no significant toxicological effects were
observed in the animals receiving 2000 or 6000 mg/kg diet and that the NOAEL was
6000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg diet (equal to 307 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw
per day). The lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) was concluded to be
18 000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg diet (equal to 907 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg
bw per day), based on local irritant changes in the forestomach and low body weight
gain (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2005a).
The Committee concluded that the changes seen in the stomach
represented local irritation in the forestomach caused by storage of ingested diet
and were thus not indicative of systemic toxicity. The Committee noted that the
observed effects on leukocytes were inconsistent within and between studies and
were not likely to be biologically significant. Furthermore, the changes were not
accompanied by histopathological changes in the progenitor cell populations of the
bone marrow or lymphoid tissue, which would be expected if the effect were due to
systemic toxicity. Therefore, the Committee concluded that the highest dietary
concentration tested, 18 000 mg/kg (equal to average doses of ethyl lauroyl arginate
of approximately 900 mg/kg bw per day in male rats and 1100 mg/kg bw per day in
female rats), was the NOAEL for systemic toxicity.
2.2.4 Genotoxicity
Several studies, carried out in compliance with GLP and OECD guidelines,
were performed to investigate the mutagenicity of ethyl lauroyl arginate, a
formulation containing ethyl lauroyl arginate in propylene glycol/water and NĮlauroyl-L-arginine (Table 5). Ethyl lauroyl arginate, the formulation and NĮ-lauroylL-arginine were tested in a reverse mutation assay (Ames test). Ethyl lauroyl
arginate and the formulation were also tested for mutagenic potential in a
mammalian cell mutation assay (mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells) and for the ability
to induce chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes. NĮ-Lauroyl-L-arginine
was assessed in an in vivo test for induction of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow
cells. Ethyl lauroyl arginate, the formulation and NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine showed no
evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in any of these assays.
2.2.5 Reproductive toxicity
In a preliminary study conducted to GLP and OECD guidelines, the effects
of ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 88.2% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) on
reproductive performance were assessed. Ethyl lauroyl arginate was administered
to Crl:CD rats at dietary concentrations of 0, 1500, 5000 or 15 000 mg/kg (equal to
0, 113, 380 and 1151 mg/kg bw per day for males; and 0, 123, 432 and 1295 mg/
kg bw per day for females). These dietary concentrations were selected based on

the results of the 13-week dietary study described above (Huntingdon Life Sciences
Ltd, 2001c) in which a NOAEL of 5000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg diet (equal to
384 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day) was identified. Groups of eight male
and eight female rats were allowed free access to the diets for 4 weeks prior to
pairing for mating. Treatment was then continued throughout mating and until
termination after weaning of the litters. The animals selected to form the F1
generation were continuously treated with diets at concentrations of 0, 1500, 5000
or 15 000 mg/kg (equal to 0, 173, 589 and 1750 mg/kg bw per day for males; and
0, 169, 586 and 1734 mg/kg bw per day for females) from the time of weaning until
termination at 8 weeks of age.
All animals were checked at least twice daily for clinical signs; once a week,
animals were subjected to a thorough physical examination. Body weight and food
consumption were recorded at regular intervals for both the F0 and F1 animals. After
the initial 4 weeks of treatment, F0 females were paired on a one-to-one basis with
males from the same treatment group. Mating was ascertained by vaginal smears
and ejected copulation plugs, and the day on which mating was detected was
designated day 0 of gestation. Once mating had occurred, the males and females
were separated. All F0 females were allowed to deliver their young naturally and
rear their own offspring until day 21 of lactation. All litters were examined at day 1
of age for numbers of live and dead pups, body weights, sex ratio and general
clinical observations; and subsequently examined daily for clinical signs and dam/
litter interaction until day 21 of age. Following weaning, offspring were selected for
the F1 generation based on a random numbers table (12 males and 12 females per
treatment group). Sexual maturation was assessed for the selected F1 males and
females, and body weights were recorded twice weekly.
F0 males were culled after successful littering by females, and F0 females
were culled after their litters were weaned. All F0 animals were subjected to a
detailed macroscopic examination, and samples of any abnormal tissues were
taken. The number of implantation sites was recorded for F0 females. All F1 animals
were subjected to a detailed macroscopic examination.
The general condition of treated F0 and F1 animals was similar to that of
controls, and no deaths occurred. Body weight and body weight gain of F0 males
and females were not adversely affected by treatment. Body weight of F1 males and
females and body weight gain to 8 weeks of age were unaffected by treatment. Food
consumption was similar in all groups of F0 animals, both before mating and, for
females, during gestation and lactation. Food consumption of F1 animals was similar
to that of controls, and there were no clear effects on food conversion efficiency in
F0 animals in the pre-pairing period or in the F1 animals up to 8 weeks of age. In the
F0 females, the intakes of ethyl lauroyl arginate increased during lactation in
response to the physiological demands of the litter, reaching a level of approximately
twice the premating intake during the 2nd week of lactation. F1 animals had higher
intakes of ethyl lauroyl arginate than did their F0 parents, as expected based on the
higher food consumption of young animals. Mating performance, fertility, gestation
length, gestation index, numbers of implantations and litter sizes were similar in all
groups and were considered to be unaffected by treatment up to 15 000 mg/kg diet.
At 15 000 mg/kg diet, the litters of two of the eight females lost body weight in the

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

59

first 4 days after birth and were killed on day 4 of age for humane reasons. The
predominant finding at necropsy was the absence of milk in their stomachs; the
authors concluded that this reflected reduced lactation by the two dams in the early
postnatal period. There was also a small reduction in survival of the offspring within
the remaining litters at 15 000 mg/kg diet, although this was not associated with any
effect on growth. The authors concluded that a possible association between
treatment and postnatal offspring death could not be excluded.
Sex ratio and body weight of the offspring at day 1 of age were unaffected
by treatment. F1 body weight gain throughout the pre-weaning period and to
termination was unaffected by treatment (from both indirect exposure via the milk
and direct exposure via independent feeding). Sexual maturation of the F1 males
was unaffected by treatment, but vaginal opening of the F1 females at 15 000 mg/
kg diet was delayed by 4 days. There was no consistent treatment-related
relationship between body weight and time of vaginal opening. The authors
considered that the delay in vaginal opening was treatment related but had no
lasting impact upon the normal sexual development of F1 females, because normal
estrous cycles were established in all treatment groups. There were no findings at
necropsy of either the F0 or F1 animals. Of the two F0 females whose litters were
terminated, the mammary tissue appeared inactive or had only small amounts of
milk present. The authors concluded that a maximum dietary concentration of
15 000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg diet (equal to 1151 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg
bw per day) could be used in a subsequent two-generation study in the rat
(Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2003b).
(a)

Multigeneration reproductive toxicity

The influence of ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 88.2% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl) on reproductive performance was assessed in compliance with GLP
and OECD guidelines by administration to Crl:CD(SD)IGS BR rats continuously in
the diet through two successive generations. F0 animals (groups of 28 males and
28 females) received diets containing ethyl lauroyl arginate at concentrations of 0,
2500, 6000 or 15 000 mg/kg diet (equal to 0, 181, 434 and 1073 mg/kg bw per day
for males; and 0, 207, 502 and 1226 mg/kg bw per day for females) for 10 weeks
before pairing, throughout pairing, gestation and lactation, and until termination.
F1 animals (groups of 24 males and 24 females) were similarly treated from 4 weeks
of age, with dietary concentrations equal to 0, 224, 537 and 1356 mg/kg bw per day
for males; and 0, 246, 582 and 1489 mg/kg bw per day for females. The F2
generation was raised to weaning, following which the study was terminated.
Throughout the study, data were recorded on clinical condition and general
health, body weight, food consumption, estrous cycles, mating performance and
fertility, gestation length and parturition observations. F0 and F1 animals were culled
when their litters had weaned and subjected to a detailed necropsy, including
macroscopic and microscopic investigations. Organs were weighed and subjected
to histological examination. Seminal analysis was performed on all F0 and F1 males.
All litters were assessed for clinical condition, litter size and survival, sex ratio, body
weight, sexual maturation (F1 generation only) and physical development. F2

60

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

animals were similarly necropsied at weaning for macroscopic investigation and
organ weight analysis.
The general condition of F0 and F1 animals receiving diets containing ethyl
lauroyl arginate was similar to that of controls. Mortality occurred in three F0 and
three F1 animals: in the F0 generation, one male at 2500 mg/kg diet and one female
at 15 000 mg/kg diet were killed for animal welfare reasons; and one male at
15 000 mg/kg diet was found dead (histopathological examination revealed a
malignant nephroblastoma). In the F1 generation, one male receiving 15 000 mg/kg
diet was killed for humane reasons; and two females, one from each of the 2500
and 15 000 mg/kg diet groups, were killed for reasons of animal welfare after their
offspring were weaned. All of these deaths were considered by the authors not to
be related to treatment. Overall, body weight and body weight gain of the F0 males
were not affected by treatment. Body weight gain for F0 treated females was
significantly greater during gestation (by between 9% and 19%) than that of the
concurrent control; however, body weight gain during lactation returned to a level
similar to that of controls. At 15 000 mg/kg diet, body weight gain of F1 animals was
reduced from day 14 of age as animals established independent feeding. Overall,
body weight change of F1 males up to termination was not affected by treatment;
however, body weight gain of F1 females remained lower than that of controls until
lactation, when the difference was reversed and treated animals gained more body
weight than controls. Food consumption and food conversion efficiency were
unaffected by treatment in both F0 and F1 animals.
There were no effects of treatment in either the F0 or F1 generation on
premating estrous cycles, mating performance, fertility or gestation length. Sexual
maturation of the F1 generation was unaffected by treatment in males; in females,
vaginal opening was significantly delayed by 4 days in the group receiving ethyl
lauroyl arginate at 15 000 mg/kg in the diet. This finding was considered by the
authors to be related to treatment; there was no effect on vaginal opening of females
in the 6000 or 2500 mg/kg diet groups. F1 litter size, survival and sex ratio were
unaffected by ethyl lauroyl arginate treatment. The physical development of F1 litters
was comparable in all groups and not affected by treatment.
Terminal investigations of F0 and F1 adult animals showed no effects on pretermination estrous cycles or on sperm assessment. Macroscopic examination of
F0 and F1 adults did not reveal any changes attributable to treatment, nor were there
any microscopic findings. Organ weights for F0 males were unaffected by treatment;
however, F0 females showed significantly reduced relative weights for the spleen
(15 000 mg/kg diet) and ovaries (2500 and 15 000 mg/kg diet) when compared with
controls. This was considered by the authors not to be toxicologically significant, as
there was no dose-dependent trend, and the relative weight differences were small
(within 10% of control). Reduced organ weights were observed in F1 offspring
(weanlings) at 15 000 mg/kg diet (absolute and relative spleen and thymus weights)
and at 6000 mg/kg diet (relative thymus weight). However, there were no conclusive
effects of treatment on organ weights of F1 adults. Necropsy of F1 offspring showed
no treatment-related changes.

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

61

The general condition of the F2 offspring was similar to that of controls, and
there were no effects of treatment on litter size, survival or sex ratio. There was a
significant small reduction (7%) in cumulative body weight gain in both F2 males and
females at 15 000 mg/kg diet during days 1–21 of age; however, this resolved by
day 25. Poor performance (not significant) was recorded for one of the physical
development tests (startle response) in the F2 litters. This was due to two litters
failing at both 6000 and 15 000 mg/kg diet. Macroscopic examination of the F2
offspring showed no effects, but both males (non-significant) and females
(significant) showed a reduction in absolute spleen weights at 15 000 mg/kg diet
(12% and 14%, respectively, of that of controls).
The authors concluded that the NOAEL for reproductive performance in the
rat was 15 000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg diet (equal to 1073 mg ethyl lauroyl
arginate/kg bw per day). The effects observed at this concentration (reduction in
offspring body weight gain prior to weaning, delay in vaginal opening of F1 females
and reduced spleen weights among F1 and F2 offspring) were considered by the
authors to be transient. The authors reasoned that for the observed reductions in
spleen weight, the magnitude of the difference decreased as age increased and
was not accompanied by any macroscopic or microscopic changes in F0 and F1
adult animals. The authors reasoned that the delay in vaginal opening of F1 females
at 15 000 mg/kg was of no long-term toxicological importance and occurred at a
time when the achieved dose of ethyl lauroyl arginate was calculated to be in excess
of 1900 mg/kg bw per day (compared with the average intake of 1489 mg/kg bw per
day for F1 females) (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 2005b). However, the Committee
noted that the delay in the vaginal opening of F1 females at 15 000 mg/kg diet was
related to treatment and consistent with the preliminary study. The F2 females were
culled at weaning (day 30), and therefore vaginal opening, which occurred on
average on day 33 in control animals, was not assessed. At 15 000 mg/kg diet, there
was also an effect on the offspring body weight gain prior to weaning. Furthermore,
the critical timing of the effect on vaginal opening was uncertain. The Committee
therefore concluded that the NOAEL was at the dietary concentration of ethyl lauroyl
arginate of 6000 mg/kg diet (equal to a mean ethyl lauroyl arginate dose of 502 mg/
kg bw per day in the female rats, or 442 mg/kg bw per day expressed as ethyl-NĮlauroyl-L-arginate HCl).
(b)

Developmental toxicity

(i) Rats
Ethyl lauroyl arginate (69.1% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl, with higher
water content than other preparations) was administered by gavage to four nonpregnant female Crl:CD BR rats, in a study in compliance with GLP and OECD
guidelines, to determine tolerance for subsequent embryo-fetal toxicity studies.
From an initial dose of 250 mg/kg bw per day, the dose was doubled every 2 days
until a maximum practical dose of 2000 mg/kg bw per day was reached. Correcting
for the concentration of the active ingredient, the maximum dose was equal to
1382 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per day. The four females were then
mated with males of the same stock and dosed by gavage with the ethyl lauroyl

62

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

arginate preparation at 2000 mg/kg bw per day during days 6–12 of gestation.
Animals were then culled on day 13 of gestation. The animals were weighed and
examined daily. At termination, each animal was examined macroscopically and
checked for pregnancy. If lesions were evident, tissue samples were taken for
possible histopathological examination.
The general condition of all females was unaffected by treatment, and no
deaths occurred. Salivation was recorded for all animals for a short period
immediately following dosing. Body weights and body weight gain in non-pregnant
and pregnant animals were unaffected by treatment. All females were pregnant at
termination, and there were no adverse findings at necropsy. The authors concluded
that the highest dose for use in a subsequent preliminary embryo-fetal study in the
rat should be 2000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 1382 mg ethylNĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per day; Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1998a).
In the subsequent preliminary embryo-fetal toxicity study, ethyl lauroyl
arginate (purity, 69.1% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) was administered by
gavage at doses of 0, 200, 600 or 2000 mg/kg bw per day to groups of six pregnant
rats (Crl:CD BR) during days 6–19 of gestation. The study was conducted in
accordance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Allowing for composition of the test
material, the doses were equal to 0, 138, 415 and 1382 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl/kg bw per day. The objective of this preliminary study was to assess
the effects of repeated oral administration of ethyl lauroyl arginate on the progress
and outcome of pregnancy in the rat, in order to establish suitable doses for a main
embryo-fetal toxicity study. All animals were observed at least twice daily for clinical
condition and signs of reaction to treatment. Body weight and food consumption
were recorded at regular intervals throughout the study. On gestation day 20,
females were culled and examined macroscopically. The reproductive tract was
dissected out, and the following were recorded: number of corpora lutea in each
ovary, number of implantation sites, number of resorption sites, and number and
distribution of fetuses in each uterine horn. In addition, fetal examinations were
performed (body weight, sex, external abnormalities and placental weight). Half of
each litter were dissected, and the neck, thoracic and abdominal cavities were
examined.
No treatment-related clinical signs were observed during the study, and 22
animals were pregnant (only 4/6 in the control group). One female in the 200 mg/
kg bw per day dose group was killed in extremis on day 19 of gestation after showing
reduced food intake (2 g/day) on days 18–19 and a body weight loss of 40 g over
the same period. This female showed signs of pallor, piloerection, brown staining
around the left eye, red urine and a perigenital discharge. Necropsy revealed a large
amount of red fluid within the vagina and both uterine horns, and the uterus
contained 15 late resorptions. The authors concluded that, in the absence of similar
findings in animals of the higher dose groups, the findings in this female were
unrelated to treatment with ethyl lauroyl arginate.
Salivation was recorded on a number of occasions for a short period
immediately after dosing at 600 mg/kg bw per day and more frequently at 2000 mg/
kg bw per day. Respiratory noises were noted for one female in each of the

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

63

treatment groups. There were no other significant clinical signs reported in any of
the animals. Body weight, body weight gain and food consumption were unaffected
by treatment, apart from the one female in the 200 mg/kg bw per day dose group
(discussed above). There were no treatment-related findings at necropsy. Two
females, one in each of the groups receiving 200 and 2000 mg/kg bw per day,
showed high pre-implantation losses; however, because these losses were deemed
by the authors to have occurred before the start of treatment, these two incidences
were considered not to be related to treatment. The group mean value for postimplantation loss was higher in animals receiving 600 mg/kg bw per day (8%)
compared with other groups (1–3%); however, in the absence of a similar effect in
the top dose group, the authors considered this to be unrelated to treatment. There
were no treatment-related effects on fetal survival or development.
The authors concluded that ethyl lauroyl arginate at doses up to 2000 mg/
kg bw per day during days 6–19 of gestation had no significant effects on dams or
on the survival and development of their fetuses. A high dose level of 2000 mg ethyl
lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 1382 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/
kg bw per day) was considered to be the maximum suitable dose for a subsequent
embryo-fetal study (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1998b).
In the main embryo-fetal toxicity study, four groups of 22 pregnant female
rats (Sprague-Dawley CD) were administered ethyl lauroyl arginate (purity, 69.1%
ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl) by gavage at concentrations of 0, 200, 600 or
2000 mg/kg bw per day during days 6–19 of gestation. This study was conducted
in accordance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Allowing for the composition of the
test material, the doses were equal to 0, 138, 415 and 1382 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl/kg bw per day. All animals were observed at least twice daily
throughout the study for clinical condition and signs of reaction to treatment. Body
weight and food consumption were recorded at regular intervals throughout the
study. On gestation day 20, females were culled and examined macroscopically.
The reproductive tract was dissected, and the following were recorded: weight of
gravid uterus, number of corpora lutea in each ovary, number of implantation sites,
number of resorption sites, and number and distribution of fetuses in each uterine
horn. In addition, fetal examinations were performed (body weight, sex, external and
internal abnormalities, placental weight).
Three females receiving 2000 mg/kg bw per day were killed in extremis on
day 7 or 8 of gestation, after 2 or 3 days of dosing. All three animals had noisy and
gasping respiration and salivation after dosing. Two of the females showed
significant body weight loss before termination, and one of these two showed signs
of underactive behaviour and piloerection. Necropsy of all three animals revealed
large amounts of gaseous material in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the
stomach. Other necropsy findings observed in some of these three animals included
enlarged and prominent lymph nodes, haemorrhagic lungs, large amounts of pale
yellow viscous material in the ileum, reduced and hydrated caecal contents, dark
and enlarged adrenals and a pronounced internal structure of the kidneys. All of
these three females were pregnant, and implantation sites were normal. In addition,
two females receiving 600 mg/kg bw per day were similarly affected towards the
end of gestation, both showing signs of noisy respiration, salivation at the time of

64

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

dosing and body weight losses. Both were killed on day 17 of gestation for humane
reasons, and necropsy revealed that the gastrointestinal tract was distended with
gaseous material. Both animals were pregnant, and implantation sites were normal.
The general condition of the surviving animals was good, and all were
pregnant. Noisy respiration was observed in all treatment groups, in a dose-related
manner. The authors noted that this may have resulted from aspiration of increased
secretions and/or traces of the dosing material following treatment with the more
concentrated/viscous suspensions at the higher doses. The respiratory distress was
considered by the authors not to be a systemic response. Salivation at the time of
dosing was seen in all animals receiving 2000 mg/kg bw per day on approximately
50% of occasions. Fourteen animals receiving 600 mg/kg bw per day showed
occasional incidences of salivation during the dosing period; at 200 mg/kg bw per
day, only one animal showed salivation on one dosing occasion. Neither noisy
respiration nor salivation was seen in the control group.
There were no overall treatment-related effects on body weight or food
consumption, although occasional animals in all treatment groups showed periods
of body weight loss and reduced food intake that were related to episodes of
respiratory distress. Of the surviving animals, there were no treatment-related
findings upon necropsy. Nor were there any treatment-related effects on fetal
survival, growth or development. The authors concluded that, because of the
maternal deaths at 600 and 2000 mg/kg bw per day, the NOAEL for the dams was
200 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 138 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl/kg bw per day), but the NOAEL for the fetuses of dams that survived
to the end of pregnancy was 2000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal
to 1382 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per day; Huntingdon Life
Sciences Ltd, 1998c).
(ii) Rabbits
A similar set of studies was conducted, in accordance with GLP and OECD
guidelines, with the same ethyl lauroyl arginate preparation administered to New
Zealand White rabbits. Ethyl lauroyl arginate was administered by gavage to two
non-pregnant female rabbits at an initial dose of 60 mg/kg bw per day, to determine
tolerance. Every 2 days, the dose was approximately doubled until a maximum
practical dose of 1000 mg/kg bw per day was reached. Allowing for the composition
of the test material, the maximum dose was equal to 691 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl/kg bw per day. The two females were then mated and dosed by gavage
with ethyl lauroyl arginate at 1000 mg/kg bw per day during days 6–12 of gestation.
The females were weighed and examined daily for signs of reaction to treatment.
At termination, each animal was examined macroscopically and checked for
pregnancy. If disease was evident, tissue samples were taken for histopathology.
The general condition of all females was unaffected by treatment, and no
deaths occurred. During the escalating-dose phase, marginal losses (50 g) in body
weight were recorded for one of the females at 500 mg/kg bw per day on 1 day and
for both females (50–120 g) at 1000 mg/kg bw per day on 1 day. During the constantdose phase, both females showed reduced food and water intake from day 8 of

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

65

gestation, with reduced food intake and reduced faecal output being observed until
termination, associated with marked weight loss. Weight loss continued to
termination in one female, but the other female showed some recovery in body
weight towards the end of the treatment period. On day 7 of gestation, one animal
became stressed during dosing, and dosing had to be delayed by 30 min. On day
8 of gestation, the other animal showed respiratory distress, with noisy respiration
recorded daily until termination. Both females were pregnant at termination, and
there were no apparent adverse findings on the fetuses. Necropsy revealed some
evidence of collapse of areas of the lung in both animals, particularly in the female
that had shown signs of respiratory distress. Both animals also showed prominent
dark vessels on the surface of the kidneys, but the significance of this was unknown.
The authors concluded that the highest dose for use in a subsequent preliminary
embryo-fetal study in the rabbit should be 1000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per
day (equal to 691 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per day; Huntingdon
Life Sciences Ltd, 1998d).
In the subsequent preliminary embryo-fetal toxicity study, ethyl lauroyl
arginate was administered by gavage at doses of 0, 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw per
day to groups of four pregnant New Zealand White rabbits during days 6–19 of
gestation (six animals in the control group). Allowing for the composition of the test
material, the doses were equal to 0, 173, 346 and 691 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl/kg bw per day. The objective of this preliminary study was to assess
the effects of repeated oral administration of ethyl lauroyl arginate on the progress
and outcome of pregnancy in the rabbit, in order to establish suitable doses for a
main embryo-fetal toxicity study.
All animals were observed at least twice daily for clinical condition and signs
of reaction to treatment. Body weight and food consumption were recorded at
regular intervals throughout the study. On gestation day 29, females were culled
and examined macroscopically. The reproductive tract was dissected out, and the
following were recorded: number of corpora lutea in each ovary, number of
implantation sites, number of resorption sites, and number and distribution of
fetuses in each uterine horn. In addition, fetal examinations were performed (body
weight, sex, external and internal abnormalities, placental weight).
There were no deaths during the study, and all animals were pregnant with
live fetuses at termination. One animal at 250 mg/kg bw per day and one at
1000 mg/kg bw per day had periods when the respiration was noisy or slow, and
the authors concluded that this did not appear to be related to dosing. Small losses
in body weight were recorded during the 1st week of treatment (days 6–12 of
gestation) for 2/6 control animals, 1/4 animals at 250 mg/kg bw per day, 2/4 at
500 mg/kg bw per day and 3/4 at 1000 mg/kg bw per day. By day 28 of gestation,
adjusted body weight gains showed no intergroup differences. In animals receiving
1000 mg/kg bw per day, food consumption was lower than that of control animals,
particularly during gestation days 6–12 (82 g/animal per day compared with
113–136 g/animal per day for the other three groups), but was then higher than that
of control animals in the first 4 days after treatment stopped. In animals receiving
500 mg/kg bw per day, food intake was slightly lower throughout treatment, but then
increased after completion of dosing. There were no treatment-related findings at

66

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

necropsy, nor were there any treatment-related effects on embryo-fetal survival.
Fetal weight was lowest at 1000 mg/kg bw per day (35.7 g compared with
40.2–43.7 g for the other three groups), but this was attributed to a large litter size
in this group. There was a low incidence of fetal anomalies in all groups, with no
indication of any relation to treatment.
The authors concluded that the maternal NOEL was 250 mg ethyl lauroyl
arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 173 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per
day), based on effects on food consumption and body weight gain at the higher
doses. The fetal NOEL was concluded to be 1000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw
per day (equal to 691 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per day). A high
dose level of 1000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 691 mg ethylNĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl/kg bw per day) was considered to be the maximum dose
for a subsequent embryo-fetal study (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1998e).
Four groups of 22 pregnant female New Zealand White rabbits were
administered ethyl lauroyl arginate by gavage at concentrations of 0, 100, 300 or
1000 mg/kg bw per day during days 6–19 of gestation. Allowing for the composition
of the test material, the doses were equal to 0, 69, 207 and 691 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroylL-arginate HCl/kg bw per day. All animals were observed at least twice daily
throughout the study for clinical condition and signs of reaction to treatment. Body
weight and food consumption were recorded at regular intervals throughout the
study. On gestation day 29, females were culled. The reproductive tract was
dissected, and the following were recorded: weight of gravid uterus, number of
corpora lutea in each ovary, number of implantation sites, number of resorption
sites, and number and distribution of fetuses in each uterine horn. In addition, fetal
examinations were performed (body weight, sex, external and internal
abnormalities, placental weight).
Signs of reaction to treatment were largely associated with dosing difficulty
and signs of respiratory distress, seen in five animals at 300 mg/kg bw per day and
five animals at 1000 mg/kg bw per day. The authors attributed the respiratory
reactions to irritation caused by the physical nature of the highly concentrated
suspension and to aspiration of traces of the test material. Two females at 1000 mg/
kg bw per day had to be replaced early in treatment because of difficulties in dosing
and poor acclimatization. There were no other treatment-related clinical signs. One
animal at 1000 mg/kg bw per day was killed for humane reasons on day 9 of
gestation following periods of noisy respiration, accompanied by reduced food
consumption and faecal output and an aqueous discharge from the urogenital area.
Similarly, one animal at 300 mg/kg bw per day was killed for humane reasons on
day 14 of gestation because of gasping respiration following dosing. Necropsy of
these two animals revealed some lung congestion, incomplete collapse of the lungs
and occasional dark areas on the lung surfaces. One female at 1000 mg/kg bw per
day aborted two dead fetuses on day 24 of gestation; necropsy revealed three
empty implantation sites in the left uterine horn and no implantation sites in the right
horn. Of the 88 females in the study, 76 were pregnant and carried a live litter to
termination (day 29 of gestation).

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

Body weight gain of animals receiving 1000 mg/kg bw per day was
significantly lower than that of the controls throughout treatment (45% of that of
controls). Food consumption in this treatment group was significantly lower in the
2nd week of treatment (days 13–19 of gestation, 79% of that of controls). These
effects were considered by the authors to be treatment related. Body weight gains
and food consumption of animals receiving 100 and 300 mg/kg bw per day were
similar to those of controls. There were no treatment-related effects upon the dam
or litter survival or on fetal or placental weight. There was a low incidence of fetal
anomalies in all groups, which were not related to treatment. The authors concluded
that 300 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 207 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroylL-arginate HCl/kg bw per day) was the NOAEL for the dam, based on effects on
maternal body weight gain and food intake. The NOAEL for the fetus was concluded
to be 1000 mg ethyl lauroyl arginate/kg bw per day (equal to 691 mg ethyl-NĮ-lauroylL-arginate HCl/kg bw per day), based on no adverse effects upon survival and
development up to the maximum dose tested (Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd, 1998f).
2.3

Observations in humans

Three adverse events were reported by two of six subjects in a
pharmacokinetic study reported in section 2.1.1. One subject at 2.5 mg/kg bw
reported headache, and one subject at 1.5 mg/kg bw reported diarrhoea and
flatulence. Both events were considered to be mild in nature, and the authors
concluded that these events were unlikely to be related to treatment. There were
no clinically significant changes in the clinical parameters assessed (CentraLabS
Clinical Research Ltd, 2005b).

DIETARY EXPOSURE

3.1

Introduction

The Committee has not previously evaluated the dietary exposure to ethyl
lauroyl arginate. Ethyl lauroyl arginate is used as a preservative to protect food
against microbial contamination and spoilage. The active ingredient responsible for
the preservative action is ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl, which is present in the
article of commerce at a level in the range 85–95%. The Committee noted that use
levels based on the active ingredient are approximately 15% lower than those based
on the article of commerce (i.e. the use level for the article of commerce is “up to
225 mg/kg” compared with “up to 200 mg/kg” for the active ingredient).
3.2

Use in foods

Ethyl lauroyl arginate is used in the food categories listed in Table 6, at the

International estimates of dietary exposure

The current Global Environment Monitoring System – Food Contamination
Monitoring and Assessment Programme (GEMS/Food) international diets have
been derived from 13 national clusters, based on similar dietary preferences
(accessed online, 20 May 2008, at http://www.who.int/foodsafety/chem/gems/en/
index1.html). The proposed use levels for ethyl lauroyl arginate were combined with
appropriate categories of food for each of the 13 diets. GEMS/Food-derived
consumption data (in grams per person per day) for pie fillings, gravies and sauces,
meat products, poultry products, soups and carbonated beverages were not
explicitly available. It has been assumed that the consumption of meat and poultry
as commodities takes the contribution to overall dietary exposure from meat and
poultry products into account. Pie fillings and gravies and sauces would not be
expected to contribute significantly to overall dietary exposure for ethyl lauroyl
arginate. The resulting per capita mean dietary exposures to ethyl lauroyl arginate
for each food were summed to give 13 cluster means of dietary exposure. The data
are presented in units of milligrams per day and milligrams per kilogram of body
weight per day, assuming a default body weight of 60 kg, in Table 7.
3.4

National estimates of dietary exposure

The Committee considered a national estimate of dietary exposure for the
USA submitted by the sponsor. The food consumption data used in the analysis
were based on data collected in the United States Department of Agriculture’s
1994–1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and its Supplemental
Children’s Survey. The food categories and use levels considered were those
presented in Table 6.

About 99% of the population aged 2 years and older reported consumption
of foods in one or more of the food categories listed. Based on the assumption that
ethyl lauroyl arginate is present at the proposed level in all foods within all the food
categories listed, the mean dietary exposure to ethyl lauroyl arginate for the general
population in the USA would be 3.0 mg/kg bw per day, and consumption at the 90th
percentile would be 5.6 mg/kg bw per day.
The Committee was aware that both the USA and the European Union (EU)
have issued evaluations of the use of ethyl lauroyl arginate in food. In the USA, a
GRAS notice was submitted by Laboratorios Miret S.A. for ethyl lauroyl arginate use
in foods, including meat and poultry products, at levels up to 200 mg/kg. The mean
estimated dietary exposure contained in the GRAS document was 2.2 mg/kg bw
per day, with consumption at the 90th percentile estimated to be 4.2 mg/kg bw per
day. These estimates are consistent with those contained in the dossier submitted
to the Committee.
EFSA reviewed the safety of ethyl lauroyl arginate use in a variety of food
matrices in 2007. The uses reviewed included beverages, heat-treated and dried
meat products, dried fish, rehydrated legumes, fish roe and prepared salads. For
this ensemble of treated products, national estimates of dietary exposure were
considered for 13 European countries using the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating
(DAFNE) database. These are household budget or expenditure data from Belgium,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. For the total population, the estimated
mean potential exposure to ethyl lauroyl arginate from all proposed food uses
combined ranged from 0.14 mg/kg bw per day (France) to 0.50 mg/kg bw per day
(Luxembourg), with an overall average of 0.32 mg/kg bw per day. The overall
principal contributors to potential exposure were non-alcoholic flavoured drinks
containing fruit juice (51%) and meat products (33%). An additional analysis was
available using individual dietary records from the United Kingdom National Diet
and Nutrition Survey. The mean potential exposure to ethyl lauroyl arginate for
consumers ranged from 0.11 mg/kg bw per day in the elderly to 0.83 mg/kg bw per
day in children 1.5–4.5 years old. Dietary exposure at the 97.5th percentile in
consumers only ranged from 0.37 mg/kg bw per day in the elderly to 2.89 mg/kg bw
per day in children aged 1.5–4.5 years. The Committee attributed the lower
estimates evaluated by EFSA to the reduced list of food categories proposed for
treatment with ethyl lauroyl arginate.
The Committee prepared a bounding estimate of dietary exposure to ethyl
lauroyl arginate based on default assumptions of food and beverage consumption
combined with the proposed ethyl lauroyl arginate use levels. If all solid food in the
diet, 1500 g/day (default estimate used in the USA), were treated at 200 mg ethyl
lauroyl arginate/kg, exposure would be 300 mg/day or 5 mg/kg bw per day for a
60-kg individual. The addition of 500 g/day (default estimate, USA) of beverages
treated at 100 mg/kg would result in an overall exposure of 350 mg/day or 6 mg/kg
bw per day. These bounding estimates are only slightly higher than the international
estimates of dietary exposure and the national estimate for the USA submitted to
the Committee.

COMMENTS

4.1

Toxicological data

The metabolism of ethyl lauroyl arginate has been well characterized.
Studies with radiolabelled ethyl lauroyl arginate in vitro and in vivo show that it is
well absorbed and rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester and lauroyl
amide, via NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine and, to a lesser extent, L-arginine ethyl ester, to
arginine, lauric acid and ethanol. Arginine subsequently undergoes normal amino
acid catabolism via the urea and citric acid cycles, with ultimate elimination as
carbon dioxide in the expired air and urea in the urine. Lauric acid enters normal
fatty acid metabolism, and ethanol is converted to acetate, which enters normal
biochemical pathways. Both lauric acid and ethanol are also present naturally in
foods. After administration of [13C]ethyl lauroyl arginate, the dose-corrected AUC for
NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine in humans was 60-fold that in rats. The plasma concentrations
of arginine were higher than those of NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginine, indicating that most of
the ethyl lauroyl arginate is metabolized before absorption. Given the rapid
degradation of ethyl lauroyl arginate, exposure to this compound and NĮ-lauroyl-Larginine in vivo is likely to be short.
Ethyl lauroyl arginate is of low acute toxicity. In a 13-week feeding study in
rats, the major observations were forestomach changes, such as erosions,
ulcerations and epithelial hyperplasia, indicating an irritant action, at dietary

ETHYL LAUROYL ARGINATE

concentrations of 15 000 mg/kg and greater. In addition, body weight gain and
leukocyte counts were significantly decreased in males but not in females. No
adverse effects were observed with ethyl lauroyl arginate at a dietary concentration
of 5000 mg/kg, equal to 384 mg/kg bw per day. In another 13-week study in rats
given diets containing a formulation of 19.5% ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl in
propylene glycol, body weight gain and leukocyte counts were significantly
decreased in females, but not in males, at dietary concentrations of 12 800 and
50 000 mg/kg, equal to 208 and 766 mg/kg bw per day. No treatment-related
changes were observed by histopathological examination.
Decreased food consumption and body weight gain were observed in
rats that were given ethyl lauroyl arginate at dietary concentrations of 6000 or
18 000 mg/kg for 52 weeks; these findings are likely to have been due to reduced
palatability of the diet. Ethyl lauroyl arginate caused a dose-related irritation of the
mucosal tissue of the forestomach, which was statistically significantly different from
controls, at 18 000 mg/kg, but not at 6000 or 2000 mg/kg. A reduction in the
concentration of leukocytes in the peripheral blood was seen at all doses at
26 weeks and was dose related in females but not in males. At 52 weeks, the
decrease in leukocytes was statistically significant compared with controls in males
but not in females. These differences were due to lower concentrations of
neutrophils or lymphocytes with occasional effects on monocytes and large
unstained cells, with no consistent pattern of changes in leukocytes. In addition,
evidence of neurobehavioural effects (higher low- and high-beam motor activity)
was seen in the male rats at 18 000 mg/kg. In the absence of other evidence for an
effect on the nervous system, this higher level of exploratory behaviour was
considered of doubtful association with treatment and not indicative of neurotoxicity.
The Committee concluded that the changes seen in the stomach
represented local irritation in the forestomach caused by storage of ingested diet
and were thus not indicative of systemic toxicity. The Committee noted that the
observed effects on leukocytes were inconsistent within and between studies and
were not likely to be biologically significant. Furthermore, the changes were not
accompanied by histopathological changes in the progenitor cell populations of the
bone marrow or lymphoid tissue, which would be expected if the effect were due to
systemic toxicity. Therefore, the Committee concluded that the highest dietary
concentration tested, 18 000 mg/kg (equal to average doses of ethyl lauroyl arginate
of approximately 900 mg/kg bw per day in male rats and 1100 mg/kg bw per day in
female rats), was the NOAEL for systemic toxicity.
A range of studies in vitro (bacterial mutation, cytogenetics and gene
mutation in mouse lymphoma cells) with ethyl lauroyl arginate and NĮ-lauroyl-Larginine did not provide evidence of genotoxicity.
In two studies of reproductive toxicity in rats, ethyl lauroyl arginate at a dietary
concentration of 15 000 mg/kg delayed vaginal opening by 4 days in the female
offspring. Although this effect was not accompanied by functional changes, the
Committee considered this effect to be potentially adverse and concluded that the
NOAEL for the dams was a dietary concentration of 6000 mg/kg, corresponding to
502 mg/kg bw per day expressed as ethyl lauroyl arginate, or 442 mg/kg bw per day

expressed as the active component, ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl. Studies of
potential developmental effects have been conducted in rats and rabbits given ethyl
lauroyl arginate by oral gavage during pregnancy. The material used in these
studies did not meet the proposed specifications for the content of the active
ingredient. There were no adverse effects on fetal survival or development.
Respiratory distress reported in some rats and rabbits at higher doses was
considered to be an artefactual effect resulting from gavage dosing with the irritant
solution and thus was not considered to be of relevance for dietary exposure.
Long-term studies of carcinogenicity were not available. However, the
absence of preneoplastic lesions in the 52-week study and the absence of genotoxic
activity do not suggest that ethyl lauroyl arginate has carcinogenic potential.
4.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The Committee evaluated data submitted by the sponsor, as well as
published information on an evaluation of ethyl lauroyl arginate completed by EFSA.
Additionally, the Committee prepared international estimates of dietary exposure
using GEMS/Food cluster diets.
Ethyl lauroyl arginate is used in many food types, with a maximum level for
the active ingredient of 200 mg/kg. Carbonated beverages could be treated at
concentrations of up to 100 mg/kg. The Committee noted that use levels based on
the active ingredient are approximately 15% lower than those based on the article
of commerce (i.e. the use level for the article of commerce is up to 225 mg/kg).
The current GEMS/Food international diets, derived from 13 clusters, were
used to prepare international estimates of dietary exposure. They ranged from 1.0
(cluster J) to 4.5 (cluster B) mg/kg bw per day. A few food types not expected to
contribute significantly to the overall dietary exposure were not included in the
international estimates.
The sponsor submitted an estimate of dietary exposure to ethyl lauroyl
arginate using data on food consumption from the USA. The mean dietary exposure
to ethyl lauroyl arginate for the general population in the USA would be 3.0 mg/kg
bw per day, and consumption at the 90th percentile would be 5.6 mg/kg bw per day.
The Committee noted that EFSA reviewed the safety of ethyl lauroyl arginate
in a variety of food matrices in 2007. Using the DAFNE database, the mean dietary
exposure ranged from 0.14 mg/kg bw per day (France) to 0.50 mg/kg bw per day
(Luxembourg), with an overall average of 0.32 mg/kg bw per day. Using individual
dietary records from the United Kingdom, the mean dietary exposure ranged from
0.11 mg/kg bw per day in the elderly to 0.83 mg/kg bw per day in children aged
1.5–4.5 years. At the 97.5th percentile, dietary exposure ranged from 0.37 mg/kg
bw per day in the elderly to 2.9 mg/kg bw per day in children aged 1.5–4.5 years.
The Committee noted for comparison that treatment of all solid food in the
diet (default value, 1500 g/day from the USA) at 200 mg/kg would result in a dietary
exposure of 5 mg/kg bw per day. Including treatment of carbonated beverages at
100 mg/kg (default value, 500 g/day from the USA) would make the total

theoretical maximum 6 mg/kg bw per day. These data are summarized in Table 8
in section 3.5 above.

EVALUATION

The majority of effects reported at high dietary concentrations of ethyl lauroyl
arginate are considered to be related to its irritant action and not relevant to dietary
exposure resulting from use as a food preservative. In two studies of reproductive
toxicity in rats, administration of ethyl lauroyl arginate at a dietary concentration of
15 000 mg/kg resulted in delayed vaginal opening among the female offspring.
Although this effect was not accompanied by functional changes, the Committee
considered it to be adverse and concluded that the NOAEL for this effect was a
dietary concentration of 6000 mg/kg, corresponding to 442 mg/kg bw per day
expressed as ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl, which should be used as the basis
for establishing an ADI.
The Committee established an ADI of 0–4 mg/kg bw for ethyl lauroyl
arginate, expressed as ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-L-arginate HCl, based on the NOAEL of 442
mg/kg bw per day identified in studies of reproductive toxicity and a safety factor of
100.
The Committee noted that some estimates of high-percentile dietary
exposure to ethyl lauroyl arginate exceeded the ADI, but recognized that these
estimates were highly conservative and that actual intakes were likely to be within
the ADI range.

EXPLANATION

At its fifty-fifth meeting in 2000 (Annex 1, reference 149), the Committee
concluded that paprika oleoresin is acceptable as a spice, confirming the outcome
of an evaluation performed by the Committee at its fourteenth meeting in 1970
(Annex 1, reference 22), which stated that the product was derived from a widely
consumed natural foodstuff and there were no data indicative of a toxic hazard. The
use as a spice was considered to be self-limiting and obviated the need for an
- 85 -

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

acceptable daily intake (ADI). Paprika extract was placed on the agenda of the
present meeting at the request of the Thirty-ninth Session of the Codex Committee
on Food Additives (CCFA) for assessment of safety as a food colour, specification
and exposure (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007). CCFA asked if the existing
safety assessment and specification for paprika oleoresin for use as a spice could
be extended to the use as a food colour.
Since the source material and the manufacturing process differ for paprika
preparations used as a spice and as a food colour, the name “paprika extract” was
adopted for use as a food colour, leaving the term “paprika oleoresin” for use as a
spice. The Committee was aware that the paprika preparations used for food
colouring that are currently available in the marketplace may be referred to as
paprika oleoresin. The Committee evaluated the use of paprika extract as a food
colour.
1.1

Chemical and technical considerations

Paprika extract is obtained by solvent extraction of the dried ground fruit pods
of Capsicum annuum. The major colouring principals are capsanthin and
capsorubin. Other coloured compounds such as other carotenoids are also present.
In addition to carotenoids and capsaicinoids, the extract contains mainly oil and
neutral lipids, including tocopherols derived from fruit tissues and seeds of the dry
material. Traces of volatiles may also be present; however, most of them are
removed during processing when the solvents are removed. Some carotenoids are
present as fatty acid esters. Paprika extracts have a very low content of capsaicin,
in contrast to paprika products used as flavouring agents. Extracts are slightly
viscous, homogeneous red liquids and are used to obtain a deep red colour in any
food that has a liquid/fat phase. Typical use levels are in the range of 1–60 mg/kg
finished food, calculated as colouring matter.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion
(a)

Humans

The pharmacokinetics of dietary capsanthin were determined in four male
volunteers with plasma essentially free of capsanthin at the beginning of the study.
They received paprika juice for 1 week, equivalent to three doses of 5.4 μmol
capsanthin/day, for a total of 16.2 μmol/day (Oshima et al., 1997). The level of
capsanthin in plasma reached a plateau (0.10–0.12 μmol/l) between day 2 and day
7, and capsanthin was not detectable in plasma by day 16. Capsanthin was
distributed in the plasma lipoproteins after 1 week as follows: very low density
lipoprotein, 13 ± 3%; low-density lipoprotein, 44 ± 3%; and high-density lipoprotein,
43 ± 3%. In a separate experiment involving the single ingestion of paprika juice
(equivalent to 34.2 μmol capsanthin) by the same men, the plasma concentration

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

87

of capsanthin ranged from 0.10 to 0.29 μmol/l at 8 h after ingestion. In contrast, the
elevation of the plasma concentration of an acyclic hydrocarbon carotenoid,
lycopene, by a single ingestion of tomato soup (equivalent to 186.3 mmol lycopene)
in the same subjects was minimal (0.02–0.06 mmol/l). The areas under the plasma
concentration–time curves for capsanthin between 0 and 74 h and for lycopene
between 0 and 72 h were 4.68 ± 1.22 and 0.81 ± 0.17 (μmol·h)/l, respectively. The
half-lives were calculated to be 20.1 ± 1.3 h for capsanthin and 222 ± 15 h for
lycopene. It was concluded that the clearance of capsanthin is much faster than that
of lycopene, although capsanthin is transported into plasma lipoproteins in larger
amounts.
The bioavailability of carotenoids from a paprika oleoresin (zeaxanthin, ȕcryptoxanthin, ȕ-carotene, capsanthin, capsorubin) was assessed in humans. After
overnight fasting, nine volunteers ingested a single dose of a paprika oleoresin
containing 6.4 mg zeaxanthin, 4.2 mg ȕ cryptoxanthin, 6.2 mg ȕ-carotene, 35.0 mg
capsanthin and 2.0 mg capsorubin. At different time points, the carotenoid pattern
in the chylomicron fraction of whole blood was analysed to evaluate carotenoid
absorption. From the major carotenoids present in the paprika oleoresin, only
zeaxanthin, ȕ-cryptoxanthin and ȕ-carotene were detectable in measurable
amounts. Although the xanthophylls in paprika oleoresin were mainly present as
mono- or diesters, only free zeaxanthin and ȕ-cryptoxanthin were found. The
bioavailability of the pepper-specific carotenoids capsanthin and capsorubin from
paprika oleoresin was found to be very low (Pérez-Gálvez et al., 2003).
(b)

Rats

Donnerer et al. (1990) reported on a study in which rats were gavaged with
a mixture of capsaicinoids. These substances were extensively metabolized by a
variety of metabolic pathways, including 1) hydrolysis of the acid–amide bond and
deamination to form vanillylamine, 2) hydroxylation of the vanillyl ring, 3) oxidation
of the hydroxyl group in the ring and 4) oxidation of the terminal carbon in the sidechain. Kawada & Iwai (1985) reported that within 48 h after oral administration of
dihydrocapsaicin to rats, 8.7% of the dose was excreted in urine and 10% in faeces.
The urine contained vanillylamine, vanillin, vanillyl alcohol and vanillic acid.
2.2

Toxicological studies

2.2.1 Short-term studies of toxicity
(a)

Mice

The toxicity of red chilli was examined in male B6C3F1 mice fed a
commercial meal diet mixed with ground Capsicum annuum Linnaeus (L.) at levels
of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 or 10% by weight (w/w). Mice were offered control or test
diets ad libitum starting at 6 weeks of age. Feed consumption was measured daily,
and individual body weights were recorded weekly for the 4-week feeding period.
General health, body weight and feed intake were apparently not adversely affected
at any level of pepper consumption. Histopathological evaluation revealed slight
glycogen depletion and anisocytosis of hepatocytes in the 10% group. However,

88

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

other organs did not reveal any lesions attributable to the chilli exposure. The
authors concluded that red chilli was relatively non-toxic at the doses tested in
male B6C3F1 mice. No information about the carotenoid content of the red chilli
preparation was provided (Jang et al., 1992).
(b)

Rats

A 13-week toxicity study with paprika extract was performed in F344 rats.
The study was conducted using a paprika colour preparation (hexane extract) with
a colour value of 1570, which corresponds to a total carotenoid content of
approximately 7.5%. To establish a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for
application in subsequent long-term studies, rats were fed powdered diet containing
paprika colour at dose levels of 0 (basal diet), 0.62, 1.25, 2.5 or 5% for 13 weeks.
During the experiment, there were no remarkable changes in general appearance,
and no deaths occurred in any experimental group. Although serum total cholesterol
was dose-dependently increased in both sexes, no related histopathological
changes were observed in the liver. Slight inflammatory cell infiltration in the
myocardium and vacuolation of hepatocytes were noted in both control and treated
animals, but there were no clear differences between groups. In conclusion, paprika
oleoresin at 5% in the diet (2948.4 mg/kg body weight [bw] per day for male rats
and 3197.4 mg/kg bw per day for female rats) did not cause adverse effects in F344
rats. Thus, the NOAEL and the maximum dose level for carcinogenicity testing of
paprika extract were concluded to be 5% in the diet, equivalent to approximately
3000 mg/kg bw (Kanki et al., 2003).
The effects of red chilli were examined in 12-week-old male Wistar rats fed
a commercial diet mixed with ground Capsicum frutescens L. fruits at levels of 2%
or 10% w/w for 8 weeks. General health, body weight gain, feed intake and feed
efficiency were not adversely affected in the rats fed with 2% Capsicum, whereas
feed intake and growth rate were depressed and exfoliation of the intestinal
epithelium into the lumen and cytoplasmic fatty vacuolation and necrosis of the
centrilobular hepatocytes were observed in rats at 4 and 8 weeks with 10%. This
correlated with changes in haematology, serum enzyme profiles and other serum
constituents. The authors did not provide any information about the capsaicin
content of the fruits, which had been purchased from a local market in Saudi Arabia
(Al-Qarawi & Adam, 1999).
2.2.2 Long-term studies of toxicity and carcinogenicity
Akagi et al. (1998) conducted a long-term study in groups of 50 male and
50 female B6C3F1 mice that were given graded doses of 0, 0.025, 0.083 or 0.25%
of a mixture consisting of 64% capsaicin and 32.6% dihydrocapsaicin. Food
consumption was reduced in all treated groups compared with controls. The authors
reported that there was no evidence of carcinogenicity.
Recently, Inoue et al. (2008) published a report of a chronic toxicity study
and a carcinogenicity study conducted on paprika extract. In this study, groups of
60 male and 60 female rats were provided with dietary concentrations of 0, 2.5
or 5% paprika extract. In both studies, haematological parameters and serum

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

89

biochemical parameters were assessed. At the end of the chronic study (52 weeks),
10 animals per group were killed, and the balance of surviving animals were killed
at the end of the 104-week carcinogenicity study. All animals were subjected to
complete pathological evaluation. There were no effects in either study on survival
rates, clinical signs of toxicity, or food consumption and body weight. Likewise, there
were no effects on haematological parameters, serum biochemical measures or
organ weights. There also was no evidence of pathological changes, with the
exception of an increased incidence of hepatocellular vacuolation in the 5% males,
a finding the authors noted was not adverse. Likewise, there was no effect of
treatment on the pattern or incidence of tumours.
2.3.3 Genotoxicity
Numerous studies have been performed with extracts of chilli peppers
and with samples of capsaicin of different levels of purity, and the findings have
been mixed, inconsistent and often contradictory. For example, both capsaicin
and extracts were reported to show positive effects in bacterial assays (Toth et al.,
1984; Damhoeri et al., 1985; Nagabhushan & Bhide, 1985; Venkat et al., 1995), with
inconsistent results in the presence or absence of S9 mix for metabolic activation,
whereas both capsaicin (Damhoeri et al., 1985) and extracts (Buchanan et al.,
1981) were reported to have no effects in other bacterial tests. Both positive
(Nagabhushan & Bhide, 1985; Lawson & Gannett, 1989) and negative
(Nagabhushan & Bhide, 1985) results have been reported in assays using Chinese
hamster V79 cells. Capsaicin was found to induce deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
damage in cultured neuroblastoma cells at doses that were also shown to be
cytotoxic, as monitored by inhibition of protein synthesis (Richeux et al., 1999).
Studies conducted in mice have shown that pepper extract can induce micronuclei
in bone marrow, but that the capsaicin-containing fraction does not (Villasenor & de
Ocampo, 1994; Villasenor et al., 1995). In contrast, Arceo et al. (1995) reported that
capsaicin induces micronuclei in the mouse and also sister chromatid exchange
only at the highest dose, whereas capsaicin administered intraperitoneally to mice
did not induce dominant lethal mutation (Muralidhara & Narasimhamurthy, 1988).
Since the time of these earlier studies and of the review in 2002 by the
Scientific Committee on Food, more definitive studies have been performed using
pure capsaicin. In a battery of studies, Chanda et al. (2004) found that pure
capsaicin induced a weak response after 4 h of treatment in the range of toxic
concentrations in the mouse lymphoma assay but was non-mutagenic when
treatment was extended to 24 h, and they commented that the criteria for positive
results from this assay remain controversial. Results were uniformly negative using
pure capsaicin in the Ames test and in human lymphocytes assayed for
chromosomal aberrations (Chanda et al., 2004; Proudlock et al., 2004). Finally, in
whole animal studies, bone marrow micronuclei were not induced either in the
mouse (Chanda et al., 2004) or in the rat (Proudlock et al., 2004).
Taken as a whole, it can be concluded that pure capsaicin is non-genotoxic
in standard genotoxicity assays and has no in vivo genotoxic potential.

2.3.4 Reproductive toxicity
No results from reproductive toxicity studies for paprika oleoresin are
available. Data for capsaicin were reviewed recently by Johnson (2007).
2.4

Observations in humans

Lopez-Carrillo et al. (1994) first reported an association between selfreported consumption of chilli peppers and increased risk of gastric cancer. This
study included 220 cases of gastric cancer and 752 controls selected from the
general population. It was reported that chilli pepper consumption was associated
with a 5.5-fold increase in risk of gastric cancer, whereas heavy consumption
showed a 17-fold greater risk. In a subsequent study by Lopez-Carrillo et al. (2003),
281 cases with gastric cancer and 523 hospital controls were interviewed with
respect to the consumption of chilli peppers. Chilli pepper consumption was used
as a surrogate for capsaicin intake, which was calculated based on reported levels
of capsaicin in various chilli types. The analysis was controlled for Helicobacter
pylori infection, a known cause of gastric cancer. The authors reported a significantly
increased risk of gastric cancer in individuals who consumed capsaicin in the form
of chilli peppers that was independent of H. pylori infection.
Notani & Jayant (1987) reported on a case–control study from India, which
demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx,
oesophagus and larynx in consumers of red chilli powder.

DIETARY EXPOSURE

Paprika extract is used in a wide range of foods as a colour. There were
limited data on potential dietary exposures to total carotenoids (sum of capsanthin,
capsorubin and all other carotenoids) from use of paprika extract as a food
colour. Capsanthin and capsorubin are the main compounds responsible for the
colour. The tentative specifications for paprika extract as a food colour limit the
concentration of total carotenoids to not less than 7%, with capsanthin and
capsorubin not less than 30% of the total carotenoids.
Paprika extracts have a very low content of capsaicin, in contrast to the
paprika preparations used as flavouring agents. No dietary exposure data were
submitted for the capsaicin component of paprika extract.
Some data were available on potential dietary exposure to total carotenoids
from consumption of fresh, dried peppers and chilli peppers. These data were used
to put the potential dietary exposure to total carotenoids from use of paprika extract
as a food colour into the context of the whole diet.
3.1

Poundage data

Production data for Europe on the amount of paprika oleoresin sold for use
as a food colour and as a spice were made available to the Committee at its present
meeting by the European Association for Manufacturers and Exporters of Pimentos
and Derivatives (AFEXPO) (Table 1).

Of the 1210 tonnes of paprika oleoresin sold annually, 16% was reported to
be used as a food colour (193 tonnes) (Table 1). Assuming that 7% of the paprika
extract was total carotenoids (13.5 tonnes) and assuming a European population
of 730 million (Population Reference Bureau, 2007), this would result in a potential
per capita mean dietary exposure to total carotenoids from use of paprika extract
as a food colour of 0.05 mg of total carotenoids per day.
3.2

Food balance sheet data (chillies and peppers)

Food balance sheet data on the availability of “chillies and peppers, green”
and “chillies and peppers, dried” for consumption were submitted for 157 countries,
derived from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
databases for 2004–2005 (http://faostat.fao.org). Converting the amount of fresh
peppers reported for each country to dried peppers by applying a factor of 10 and
adding to the dried pepper consumption, the total apparent consumption of dried
peppers and spices ranged from 0 to 24 g/day. Dietary exposures to total
carotenoids were estimated by combining the total amount of dried product after
applying a factor of 2 to convert to dry weight with the total carotenoid concentration
in peppers, reported to be between 5000 and 13 000 mg/kg dry weight (Deli et al.,
2001; Hornero-Mendez et al., 2002). The high carotenoid concentration of 13 000
mg/kg dry weight was for fully ripe, deep red peppers and is much higher than that
reported in food composition tables of 200–500 mg/kg for pepper or cayenne spices,
although these do have 8% water content rather than the 3–4% for the dry weight
samples, which may account for some of the difference.
The estimated total carotenoid intakes from peppers and chillies ranged
from <1–60 mg/day (assuming 5000 mg total carotenoids/kg) to <1–155 mg/day
(assuming 13 000 mg total carotenoids/kg) for the 157 countries, assuming a

92

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

conversion factor of 10 to convert fresh product to pepper and chilli spices and an
additional factor of 2 to convert to dry weight.
The countries with the highest apparent consumption of dried pepper
equivalents and hence estimated mean dietary exposures to total carotenoids were
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Jamaica, The former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Tunisia, Ghana, Romania, Malaysia, Turkey, Benin, Dominica, Mexico,
Bulgaria, Sri Lanka and Ethiopia.
3.3

Household economic survey data (paprika extract)

Estimates of paprika oleoresin dietary exposure for French consumers were
made available to the Committee at its present meeting based on the 2007 Natural
Food Colours Association (NATCOL) survey of use levels for paprika oleoresin as
a food colour (paprika extract) and estimates of household food consumption
amounts for the mean population and consumers only from the French Household
Economic Survey (Combris et al., 1998). In cases where the food groups used in
the French survey did not match the Codex General Standard for Food Additives
(GSFA) food categorization system, the nearest matching food group was used.
The total amount of food available in the household over the survey period was
divided by the number of individuals in the household and number of days of the
survey to obtain daily food consumption amounts. Typical use levels were in the
range of 1–60 mg/kg finished food, calculated as colouring matter (NATCOL use
levels are given in Appendix 1).
The estimated mean population dietary exposure to total carotenoids for the
French population was 2.3 mg/day (Table 2), assuming a total carotenoid content
for paprika oleoresin of 7.2%. The model used overestimates the use of paprika
extract in the food supply, as use at the level reported in the NATCOL survey was
assumed for all possible food categories, which in reality is unlikely. The food groups
estimated to give the highest 97.5th-percentile consumption amount for consumers
of that single food group were soups (4.6 mg total carotenoids/day), yogurts
(4.1 mg/day), precooked pastas and noodles (3.9 mg/day) and dairy desserts
(3.3 mg/day). A high-consumer estimate, obtained by taking the highest 97.5thpercentile intakes of total carotenoids for two food groups and the mean population
intakes of all the other food groups, indicated a potential total carotenoid intake of
7 mg/day (Verger, 1995).
Estimated dietary exposures for total carotenoids were within the range of
those derived from the food balance sheet data for dried pepper equivalents of
1–4 mg/day for France, at reported concentrations of 5000–13 000 mg total
carotenoids/kg dry weight.
3.4

Individual dietary records data (paprika extract)

Estimates of paprika oleoresin (paprika extract) dietary exposures for the
United Kingdom population were made available to the Committee at its present
meeting. These were based on the 2007 NATCOL survey of use levels for paprika
oleoresin as a food colour and food consumption amounts from National Diet and
Nutrition Surveys (NDNS 1992–2001) for preschool, school age, adult and elderly

populations (Gregory, 2000; Henderson et al., 2002). Assuming the use of paprika
extract in all food categories in the food supply and a total carotenoid content for
paprika extract of ~7%, estimated mean total carotenoid dietary exposures ranged
from 3 to 7 g/day (Table 2). From the NDNS data, estimated total carotenoid dietary
exposures for high consumers ranged from 6 to 13 mg/day at the 95th percentile.
Information from the United Kingdom indicates that virtually all respondents are
consumers of at least one food likely to contain paprika oleoresin; therefore, mean
dietary exposures to total carotenoids for consumers only would be expected to be
similar to the mean dietary exposures for all respondents (Gregory et al., 1995;
Finch et al., 1998; Gregory, 2000; Henderson et al., 2002).
The mean total carotenoid dietary exposures based on the NDNS data were
in the same range as the total carotenoid dietary exposures derived from the food
balance sheet data for dried pepper equivalents of 2–5 mg/day for the United
Kingdom (total carotenoid concentration from 5000 to 13 000 mg/kg).

Individual dietary records from national survey consumption data

Information from the United Kingdom’s national nutrition surveys on pepper
consumption indicates mean consumption of pepper (undefined) of 3 g/day for adult
consumers, with 97.5th-percentile consumption up to 28 g/day (Henderson et al.,
2002). Estimated consumption of peppers for younger children from the United
Kingdom was lower (Table 3) (Gregory et al., 1995; Gregory, 2000). For French
consumers, results reported from a household economic survey indicated a mean
consumption of peppers of 3 g/day and 97.5th-percentile consumption of 18 g/day
(Combris et al., 1998). The mean consumption estimates were much higher than
those for the whole population reported for dried peppers or spices for these
countries from the food balance sheet data of 0.8 g/day for the United Kingdom and
0.6 g/day for France. These figures were not converted to total carotenoid dietary
exposures, as it was unclear whether the consumption data referred to fresh or dried
peppers and chillies.

Estimated dietary exposure to capsaicin

Capsicums grown for use as fresh or dried food ingredients do not have use
level limits. For many food applications, a high capsaicin content gives greater
flavour, which is a desired characteristic associated with chilli peppers. The
capsaicin content of fresh peppers is reported to typically range up to around 1%
(Govindarajan, 1985; Lopez-Hernandez et al., 1996; Parrish, 1996; Thomas et al.,
1998).
Limited data were available on the potential dietary exposure to capsaicin
from the use of paprika extract as a food colour. Dietary exposure to capsaicin could
be predicted from estimates of dietary exposures to total carotenoids by applying a
ratio of capsaicin content to total carotenoid content; however, this ratio has not yet
been specified for paprika extract, as further information is required to complete the
evaluation.

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

95

The European Scientific Committee on Food (2002) estimated dietary
exposure to capsaicin in countries known to consume pungent spices derived from
peppers and chillies in high amounts (India, 2.5 g spices/day; Thailand, 5 g/day;
Mexico, 20 g/day) to be in the range of 25–200 mg/day, or 0.5–4 mg/kg bw,
assuming a 50-kg body weight for these countries.
3.7

Evaluation of dietary exposure

Estimated dietary exposures to total carotenoids from use of paprika extract
as a food colour were low compared with potential dietary exposures from the use
of “chillies and peppers, green” and “chillies and peppers, dried” as an ingredient or
spice. Mean estimated total carotenoid dietary exposure from use of paprika extract
as a food colour ranged from 2 to 7 mg/day for the French and United Kingdom
populations; for high consumers at the 95th percentile of dietary exposure, total
carotenoid dietary exposure was 7 mg/day in France and ranged from 6 to 13 mg/
day in the United Kingdom.
Estimated mean per capita carotenoid dietary exposures derived from the
apparent consumption of “chillies and peppers, green” and “chillies and peppers,
dried” as an ingredient or spice from the 2004–2005 food balance sheet data for
157 countries indicate that France and the United Kingdom are not high consumers
of peppers and chillies in comparison with some other countries. Estimates for mean
population dietary exposures to total carotenoids from dried pepper equivalents for
the 157 countries ranged from <1 up to 60–155 mg/day for the concentration range
of total carotenoids from 5000 to 13 000 mg/kg dry weight for peppers (France, 1–
4 mg/day; United Kingdom, 2–5 mg/day).

COMMENTS

4.1

Toxicological data

There are no indications that carotenoids from paprika extract would behave
differently from other oxygenated carotenoids with respect to their bioavailability.
Male and female rats were given paprika extract with a carotenoid content
of 7.5% and a capsaicin content of less than 0.01% at dietary levels of up to 5%,
equivalent to 3000 mg/kg bw, for 13 weeks without significant adverse effects. This
finding was supported by other short-term studies in mice and rats given crude
Capsicum extracts, where no adverse effects or only slight hyperaemia of the liver
after 60 days of exposure was reported.
In a recently completed long-term combined 52-week study of toxicity and
104-week study of carcinogenicity, rats given diets containing up to 5% paprika
extract (composition as described above) showed no evidence of toxicity or
carcinogenicity at the highest dose tested.
A number of long-term studies of carcinogenicity in rodents have
investigated various preparations of paprika and chilli and extracts of unspecified
composition from two Capsicum species (C. annuum and C. frutescens). These

96

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

long-term studies demonstrated no evidence that compounds extracted from
Capsicum species are carcinogenic in experimental animals.
The historical literature on the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of extracts of
chilli peppers and of various samples of capsaicin itself shows varied and often
contradictory results. Nonetheless, the more recent studies using short-term tests
considered in the present assessment clearly showed that pure capsaicin is not
genotoxic.
While reports of epidemiological studies conducted in India and Mexico
indicated an increased risk of gastric cancer in individuals who consumed large
quantities of chilli peppers, these studies had limitations, including potential
misclassification of subjects by exposure, large statistical imprecision of some of
the analyses, lack of control of confounding factors and possible recall bias.
Moreover, the relevance of these studies on consumption of chilli pepper to the use
of paprika extract as a food colour is uncertain.
The Committee noted that there were no studies of reproductive toxicity with
paprika extract.
4.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

Paprika extract is used in a wide range of foods as a colour. There were
limited data on potential dietary exposures to total carotenoids from use of paprika
extract as a food colour. Some data were available on dietary exposure to total
carotenoids from consumption of fresh, dried peppers and chilli peppers. These data
were used to put potential dietary exposure to total carotenoids from use of paprika
extract as a food colour into the context of the whole diet.
Production data for Europe on the amount of paprika oleoresin sold for use
as a food colour and as a spice were made available to the Committee at its present
meeting by AFEXPO. Of the 1210 tonnes of paprika oleoresin sold annually, 16%
was reported to be used as a food colour. Assuming that 7% of the paprika extract
was total carotenoids and assuming a European population of 730 million, this
resulted in a potential per capita mean dietary exposure to total carotenoids from
use of paprika extract as a food colour of 0.05 mg of total carotenoids per day.
Estimates of dietary exposure to total carotenoids from use of paprika extract
as a food colour were available for French and United Kingdom consumers. These
were based on data on food consumption from the French Household Economic
Survey, the United Kingdom NDNS and the 2007 NATCOL survey of use levels.
Assuming that 7% of the paprika extract was total carotenoids, the estimated mean
population dietary exposures to total carotenoids were 2–7 mg/day. For high
consumers in France, estimated population dietary exposure to total carotenoids
was 7 mg/day, assuming high consumption of foods containing paprika extract for
two food categories at the 97.5th percentile of exposure and at a mean level for all
other food groups. Estimated dietary exposures to total carotenoids for high
consumers in the United Kingdom at the 95th percentile of exposure ranged from 6
to 13 mg/day.

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

97

The potential dietary exposure to total carotenoids from use of paprika
extract as a colour from national survey data for France and the United Kingdom
were in the same order of magnitude as the per capita mean dietary exposures to
total carotenoids predicted from FAO food balance sheet data from consumption of
fresh and dried peppers and chillies: i.e. France, 1–4 mg/day; and United Kingdom,
2–5 mg/day (assuming a concentration of 5000–13 000 mg total carotenoids/kg dry
weight and a conversion factor of 20 for fresh peppers and 2 for dried peppers to
dry weight). However, for countries with a much higher use of peppers and chillies
in the diet, the per capita mean dietary exposure to total carotenoids predicted from
FAO food balance sheet data from consumption of fresh and dried peppers and
chillies was up to 60 mg/day (at concentrations of 5000 mg/kg dry weight) or
160 mg/day (at concentrations of 13 000 mg/kg dry weight).
Limited data were available on the potential dietary exposure to capsaicin
from the use of paprika extract as a food colour. Dietary exposure to capsaicin could
be predicted from estimates of dietary exposures to total carotenoids by applying a
ratio of capsaicin content to total carotenoid content.
5.

EVALUATION

The concentration of capsaicin in paprika extracts is to be controlled by the
specifications. Concern has been expressed in the past that capsaicin may be
carcinogenic; however, older long-term studies with capsaicin do not appear to
provide evidence for carcinogenicity, and recent studies show that pure capsaicin
is not genotoxic. The epidemiological studies reporting a relationship between
consumption of chilli pepper and increased risk of gastric cancer have considerable
limitations, which preclude the drawing of any definitive conclusion. Moreover,
the Committee expressed the view that these studies were not relevant to the
assessment of paprika extract used as a food colour.
In a well conducted 90-day study in rats given diets containing a commercial
sample of paprika extract, no adverse effects were reported at a dietary
concentration of 5%, equivalent to 3000 mg/kg bw. Similarly, in a long-term study
of combined toxicity/carcinogenicity in rats given the same material, no evidence of
toxicity or carcinogenicity was noted at dietary concentrations of up to 5%.
The Committee expressed concern as to whether the material tested in the
90-day and long-term studies was representative of all commercial production of
paprika extract. The fact that the material tested contained less than 0.01%
capsaicin and the fact that the Committee did not receive adequate data to establish
a limit for capsaicin in the specifications for paprika extract added to this concern.
The Committee requested data pertaining to the composition and capsaicin content
of various commercial samples and information as to whether the material used in
the toxicological tests was representative of all the products in commerce.
New specifications were prepared and made tentative pending the receipt
of additional information on paprika extract, including concentrations of capsaicin
and additional information about the composition of batches of extract produced by
a variety of manufacturers. Therefore, the Committee did not allocate an ADI.

98

PAPRIKA EXTRACT

The Committee noted that there were existing specifications for paprika
oleoresin with functional uses as both a colour and a flavouring agent. In response
to the call for data for the present meeting, the Committee received data on the use
of paprika preparations as a colour and as a result had no information to allow it to
revise the existing specifications for paprika oleoresin. The Committee decided that
the specifications for paprika oleoresin should be revised to emphasize its use as
a flavour.

EXPLANATION

At the request of the Codex Committee on Food Additives at its Thirty-ninth
Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007), the Committee evaluated a
preparation containing the enzyme phospholipase C from a genetically modified
strain of Pichia pastoris. Phospholipase C has not been evaluated previously by
the Committee. The systematic name of phospholipase C is phosphatidylcholine

- 107 -

108

PHOSPHOLIPASE C EXPRESSED IN PICHIA PASTORIS

cholinephosphohydrolase, and its Enzyme Commission (EC) number is 3.1.4.3.
Phospholipase C catalyses the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds at the sn-3
position in glycerophospholipids (including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine) to 1,2-diacylglycerol and the corresponding
phosphate esters. Phospholipase C is to be used in refining vegetable oils intended
for human consumption.
1.1

Genetic modification

Phospholipase C is produced by pure culture fermentation of a genetically
modified strain of P. pastoris, which expresses the phospholipase C gene
derived from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) purified from a soil sample. The
phospholipase C gene was sequenced and shown to be devoid of DNA sequences associated with haemolytic activity characteristic of certain microbial
phospholipases.
Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast, which is not known to be associated
with a disease of humans or animals. The phospholipase C production strain was
constructed by transformation of the P. pastoris host strain SMD1168 with a purified
DNA fragment containing multiple copies of the phospholipase C gene, the P.
pastoris HIS4 gene and non-coding DNA sequences necessary for expression of
both genes; and insertion of the DNA fragment into a predetermined location in the
P. pastoris genome. The P. pastoris HIS4 gene encodes histidinol dehydrogenase
and serves as a selectable marker to identify the transformed cells. The DNA
fragment used in transformation was inserted at the alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) locus
by homologous recombination.
1.2

Product characterization

Phospholipase C is produced by pure culture fed-batch fermentation of the
phospholipase C production strain. The fermentation medium consists of foodgrade materials and contains glycerol as primary carbon source. After the cellular
mass has reached a desired density, methanol is added to induce the expression
of phospholipase C. The enzyme is secreted into the fermentation medium and is
subsequently recovered by purification and concentration. The purified enzyme
concentrate is formulated and standardized to a desired activity. Methanol is
removed during purification steps, and its residues in the final product are less than
9 mg/l. The phospholipase C enzyme preparation is a yellow or brown liquid, which
typically contains 7% total organic solids (TOS).
The phospholipase C enzyme preparation conforms to the General
Specifications and Considerations for Enzyme Preparations Used in Food
Processing (Annex 1, reference 184). It will be used in refining vegetable oils to
hydrolyse phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, present in the crude oil. The resulting esters, phosphorylcholine and
phosphorylethanolamine, as well as phospholipase C itself, will be removed from
the oil during subsequent purification steps, whereas 1,2-diacylglycerol, which is
also formed as a result of phospholipid hydrolysis, will remain in the oil.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

109

Phospholipase C from P. pastoris was tested for haemolytic activity using
phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens as a positive control. No haemolytic
activity was detected.
Phospholipase C was also evaluated for potential allergenicity according to
the bioinformatics criteria proposed in the Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Consultation on Allergenicity of Foods Derived from Biotechnology (FAO/WHO
Expert Consultation, 2001). The amino acid sequence of phospholipase C was
compared with the amino acid sequences of known allergens in the Food Allergy
Research and Resource Program (FARRP) allergen database (http://
www.allergenonline.com). No sequence homology that would suggest crossreactivity of phospholipase C with known allergens was detected.
2.2

Toxicological studies

BD16449 phospholipase C is the product of a phospholipid-specific lipase
gene expressed in the yeast P. pastoris strain DVSA-PLC-004. Toxicological
studies were performed with the BD16449 phospholipase C enzyme using a
representative batch (PLC-16449-PD267B), which was produced according to the
procedure used for commercial production. The liquid enzyme concentrate was
lyophilized to produce the final, non-formulated test substance, with an average
activity of 315 U/mg (where a unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme that
hydrolyses 1 μmol of phosphatidylcholine per minute at 37 °C and pH 7.3) and a
TOS value of 83.6% by weight (w/w). Prior to use in toxicological studies, BD16449
phospholipase C was analysed for chemical and microbial composition, including
the absence of the production strain. The test article samples were also tested for
and shown to be free of antimicrobial activity and mycotoxins. Mycotoxins were
analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography for aflatoxins and
ochratoxin A and thin-layer chromatography for T-2 toxin and sterigmatocystin
(Ciofalo et al., 2006). The limits of detection for the mycotoxins tested were as
follows: aflatoxin B1, 1.0 μg/kg; aflatoxin B2, 1.0 μg/kg; aflatoxin G1, 1.0 μg/kg;
aflatoxin G2, 1.0 μg/kg; ochratoxin A, 2 μg/kg; T-2 toxin, 0.1 mg/kg; and
sterigmatocystin, 200 μg/kg.
2.2.1 Acute toxicity
BD16449 phospholipase C enzyme preparation (code DV16449, batch
PLC-16449-PD267B, 83.6% TOS) was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats by
oral gavage. Using an up–down dosing regimen that complied with Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP), a female rat did not die after being dosed with a limit dose of
2000 mg/kg body weight (bw). To confirm the finding, an additional four females
were given the same dose. The animals were monitored daily for mortality and
clinical observations, and all surviving animals were sacrificed and necropsied on
day 15.

110

PHOSPHOLIPASE C EXPRESSED IN PICHIA PASTORIS

No deaths or clinical signs were observed. Body weight was reported to be
unaffected on days 8 and 15, and no visible lesions were observed in any of the
animals at necropsy. The oral median lethal dose (LD50) was considered to be
greater than 2000 mg/kg bw (i.e. 1672 mg TOS/kg bw per day) (Fogleman, 2005a).
2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
In a study conducted in accordance with GLP requirements, groups of
20 male and 20 female Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed by oral gavage daily with
BD16449 phospholipase C enzyme preparation (code DV16449, batch PLC-16449PD267B, 83.6% TOS) at 0 (control), 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw for 13 weeks. The
dose selection was based on the results of an earlier 2-week range-finding study in
rats, in which doses of phospholipase C up to 2000 mg/kg bw per day did not
produce any adverse effects (Fogleman, 2005b). In-life observations were
conducted for mortality/morbidity (twice daily), clinical parameters (pre-dosing and
1 h post-dosing), body weight (weekly), food consumption (weekly) and
ophthalmoscopic changes (once before study initiation and during the final week of
treatment). All surviving rats were sacrificed on day 91 or 92, with haematological
and serum clinical chemistry samples taken prior to sacrifice. A complete gross
necropsy was performed on a variety of weighed organs, including the adrenals,
brain, heart, kidneys, liver, ovaries, spleen and testes. Histopathological samples
were collected and preserved from cardiovascular, digestive, urogenital,
respiratory, lymphoid/haematopoietic, endocrine, skin/musculoskeletal and
nervous tissues.
Three rats, one at 500 mg/kg bw per day and two at 2000 mg/kg bw per day,
died on treatment days 10, 63 and 72, respectively. Based on the absence of any
clinical signs prior to death or a correlation of dose with time to death, these deaths
were considered to be due to gavage misdosing. There were no treatment-related
clinical signs observed throughout the study. Although slight increases or decreases
in group mean body weight gains were reported during the study, these differences
had no effect on the group mean body weights of the treated rats compared with
controls. The mean food consumption among treatment groups was not significantly
different relative to the control groups; however, a statistically significant increased
group mean food consumption was reported for the 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw per
day females on days 15 and 22, respectively, relative to the controls. These changes
were considered incidental and unrelated to the treatment, as no dose–response
was evident. No test article–related ophthalmological findings or effects on
haematological parameters were observed. Although a few statistically significant
changes in haematological parameters in the test article–treated group compared
with the control group were noted, the values remained within the historical control
values for the laboratory and were considered incidental and unrelated to the
treatment. Similarly, a few statistically significant changes in clinical chemistry
parameters were reported for the test article–treated rats relative to concurrent
controls; however, all values remained within the historical control values for the
laboratory and were considered incidental and unrelated to the treatment. No
treatment-related findings were observed with respect to gross necropsy, organ
weight changes or histopathological examination. Overall, it can be concluded

DIETARY EXPOSURE

3.1

Intended use, use levels and residual level

The refining of raw vegetable oil following treatment with phospholipase C
can proceed by a chemical process or a physical process, although the chemical
process is more prevalent (Allen, 1997). In the chemical process, the phospholipase
C enzyme preparation is added to the refining process of vegetable oils at the first
step, which is referred to as the degumming step, and is followed by the additional
steps of bleaching and then deodorization.
The enzyme preparation is added to the unrefined vegetable oil, such as
rapeseed, corn or sunflower, at levels no higher than necessary to achieve the
intended effect. These levels are generally in the range of 100–1000 mg of enzyme
preparation per kilogram of vegetable oil, depending on the oil to be treated and the
reaction conditions (General Standard for Food Additives [GSFA] food category
02.1.2, vegetable oils and fats). This is equivalent to approximately 10 mg of purified
phospholipase C per kilogram. The reported percentage of TOS in the commercial
products is 7%.
As indicated in the submission report, the level of phospholipase C
significantly decreases with each step in the process, regardless of whether the
process uses chemical or physical processing techniques. No enzyme was found
in any of the samples besides the initial sample, suggesting that the enzyme is
actually degraded in these refining steps and not just denatured. The level of
residual phospholipase C in the final degummed vegetable oil is estimated to be
below the detection limit of the assay, set at 1 μg/kg.

Assessment of per capita dietary exposure based on data from food
balance sheets

An international assessment based on data from food balance sheets was
performed by the Committee according to the 13 Consumption Cluster Diets of the
Global Environment Monitoring System – Food Contamination Monitoring and
Assessment Programme (GEMS/Food) categorization (Annex 1, reference 177). In
this assessment, per capita daily consumption of vegetable oils and fats—including
olive, coconut, cotton seed, groundnut, linseed, maize, palm kernel, rape seed,
sesame seed, soya bean, sunflower and other oils of vegetable origin, butter of
karité and margarine—from the 13 cluster diets was combined with the maximum
use level recommended by the petitioner, 1000 mg of the commercial enzyme
preparation (7% TOS) per kilogram of vegetable oil.
Thus, if it is assumed that the enzyme is not removed from the oil and if per
capita vegetable oil consumption is considered to range from 9 g/day (cluster A) to
68 g/day (cluster B), per capita dietary exposure to phospholipase C from P.
pastoris would be estimated to range from 0.011 to 0.079 mg TOS/kg bw per day
for a 60-kg body weight adult.

Assessment of dietary exposure based on individual dietary records

An estimate of dietary exposure to phospholipase C was made by the
Committee at the present meeting based on the Concise European Food
Consumption Database for the adult population (16–64 years of age), published by
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2008 (European Food Safety
Authority, 2008). The European database compiles mean and high percentiles of
individual food consumption for 15 broad food categories from the majority of
European countries (n = 17). Mean and high levels of fat products (including
mayonnaise, dressings, béchamel and hollandaise sauces, low-fat dressings or
mayonnaise, goose fat and coconut extract) consumed by consumers only in
European Union (EU) member states were combined with the maximum use level
recommended by the petitioner of 1000 mg of the commercial enzyme preparation
(7% TOS) per kilogram of vegetable oil.
Thus, if it is assumed that the enzyme is not removed from the oil and if the
reported levels of fat products consumed by EU adult consumers are considered to
range from 21 to 59 g/day on average and from 51 to 150 g/day for high consumers
(95th percentile), dietary exposure to phospholipase C would be estimated to be
0.024–0.069 mg TOS/kg bw per day on average and 0.059–0.175 mg TOS/kg bw
per day for high consumers (95th percentile).

COMMENTS

4.1

Biochemical aspects

Phospholipase C from P. pastoris was tested for haemolytic activity using
phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens as a positive control. No haemolytic
activity was detected.
Phospholipase C was also evaluated for potential allergenicity according to
the bioinformatics criteria recommended by the FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
(2001). The amino acid sequence of phospholipase C was compared with the amino
acid sequences of known allergens. No sequence homology that would suggest that
phospholipase C is an allergen was identified.
4.2

Toxicological data

Toxicological studies were performed with the phospholipase C enzyme
using a representative batch (PLC-16449-PD267B), which was produced according
to the procedure used for commercial production. The liquid enzyme concentrate
was lyophilized to produce the final, non-formulated test substance, with an average
activity of 315 U/mg (where a unit is defined as the quantity of the enzyme that
hydrolyses 1 μmol of phosphatidylcholine per minute at 37 °C and pH 7.3) and a
TOS value of 83.6% (w/w). Before being used in toxicological studies,
phospholipase C was analysed to demonstrate that it conformed to the General
Specifications and Considerations for Enzyme Preparations Used in Food
Processing (Annex 1, reference 184).

114

PHOSPHOLIPASE C EXPRESSED IN PICHIA PASTORIS

In a 13-week study of general toxicity in rats, no significant treatment-related
effects were seen when the phospholipase C enzyme was orally administered at
doses of up to 2000 mg/kg bw per day by gavage. Therefore, the NOEL was
identified as 1672 mg TOS/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested. Phospholipase
C enzyme was not mutagenic in an assay for mutagenicity in bacteria in vitro and
was not clastogenic in an assay for chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells in
vitro. Similarly, an assay for micronucleus formation in mice showed no evidence
of a clastogenic effect in vivo.
4.3

Assessment of dietary exposure

An estimate of dietary exposure to phospholipase C was made by the
Committee based on the 13 cluster diets of the GEMS/Food categorization and on
the Concise European Food Consumption Database for the adult population (aged
16–64 years). The European database compiles mean and high percentiles of
individual food consumption for 15 broad food categories from the majority of
European countries (n = 17). The GEMS/Food database contains per capita daily
consumption of food commodities. In these estimates, reported consumption data
have been combined with the maximum use level recommended by the sponsor,
1000 mg of the commercial enzyme preparation (7% TOS content) per kilogram of
vegetable oil. For the GEMS/Food data, the food categories used in the calculation
were vegetable oils and fats, including olive, coconut, cotton seed, groundnut,
linseed, maize, palm kernel, rape seed, sesame seed, soya bean, sunflower and
other oils of vegetable origin, butter of karité and margarine). For the European
database, the food category used was the “fat products” category, including
mayonnaise, dressings, béchamel and hollandaise sauces, low-fat dressings or
mayonnaise, goose fat and coconut extract.
Mean consumption of vegetable oils ranged on average from 9 to 68 g/day
(GEMS/Food cluster diets; includes the range 21–59 g/day in Europe). For highpercentile (95th percentile) consumers in Europe, consumption of vegetable oils
ranged from 51 to 150 g/day. If the enzyme is not removed from the oil and is used
at proposed levels, the potential mean dietary exposure to phospholipase C from
P. pastoris, assuming a body weight of 60 kg, would be 0.011–0.079 mg TOS/kg
bw per day, and the potential dietary exposure for high consumers would be 0.059–
0.175 mg TOS/kg bw per day.
5.

EVALUATION

Comparing the conservative exposure estimates with the NOEL of 1672 mg
TOS/kg bw per day from the 13-week study of oral toxicity, the margin of exposure
is generally more than 10 000. The Committee allocated an acceptable daily intake
(ADI) “not specified” for phospholipase C expressed in P. pastoris, used in the
applications specified and in accordance with good manufacturing practice.

EXPLANATION

Phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters were evaluated by the Committee at its present meeting at the request of the Codex Committee on Food
Additives at its Thirty-ninth Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007a).
Phytosterols and phytostanols are substances that are similar in structure to
cholesterol and are formed exclusively in plants. They are added to food for their
blood cholesterol–lowering properties.
Phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters have not been evaluated
previously by the Committee. In 2000 (Scientific Committee on Food, 2000) and
again in 2002 (Scientific Committee on Food, 2002), the former Scientific
Committee on Food (SCF) of the European Commission assessed the safety of
phytosterols in food. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

119

responded to several Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Notices concerning
specified uses of phytosterols and phytostanols in various types of food (http://
vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~rdb/opa-gras.html#grastop).
This report describes the data on phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters
discussed at the present meeting, with the focus on newly submitted data and other
new information published since the evaluations by other regulatory bodies.
The Committee noted that phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters do not
fall into the definition of a food additive as defined by the Codex Alimentarius
Commission (2007b),1 because they do not fulfil a technological purpose in food or
food processing. At its present meeting, the Committee evaluated the safety of these
mixtures, when present in food. It is stressed that the effectiveness of these
substances in reducing blood concentrations of cholesterol was not assessed by
the Committee.
1.1

Chemical and technical considerations

Phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters are structurally related to
cholesterol, but differ in the structure of the side-chain (Figure 1). Phytosterols have
an unsaturated bond between positions 5 and 6 on the B-ring of the steroidal
skeleton, whereas this bond is saturated in phytostanols. The more common
phytosterols, ȕ-sitosterol and campesterol, are found to varying degrees in soya
bean oil and tall oil arising from wood pulping. Minor components, among them
stigmasterol and brassicasterol, are also present in other vegetable oils. The major
phytostanols are ȕ-sitostanol and campestanol. Phytosterols and phytostanols are
extracted from plant materials as the free form and as their fatty acid esters. There
are numerous commercial products, both raw materials and finished products,
containing phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters in different proportions.

“Food additive means any substance not normally consumed as a food by itself and not
normally used as a typical ingredient of the food, whether or not it has nutritive value, the
intentional addition of which to food for a technological (including organoleptic) purpose in
the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packing, packaging, transport or
holding of such food results, or may be reasonably expected to result, (directly or indirectly)
in it or its by-products becoming a component of or otherwise affecting the characteristics
of such foods. The term does not include ‘contaminants’ or substances added to food for
maintaining or improving nutritional qualities.”

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Absorption, distribution and excretion
After oral intake, phytosterol and phytostanol fatty acid esters are readily
hydrolysed by intestinal esterases (Normén et al., 2006). Studies with infusions into
the intestine of healthy humans showed that during passage from the duodenum to
the proximal jejunum, more than 40% of phytostanol esters are hydrolysed, but also
that esterification of free phytostanols (about 30%) occurs (Nissinen et al., 2007).

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

121

Free phytosterols and phytostanols are absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract to a much lower extent than cholesterol, which is taken up by 55–60% (Patel
& Thompson, 2006). Published data reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Food
(2002) indicated that in humans, about 5% of ȕ-sitosterol, 15% of campesterol and
less than 1% of phytostanols are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. In humans,
esterified and free phytosterols and phytostanols are mainly transported by lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL). In healthy adults, less than 1% of total plasma sterol
consists of phytosterols (Moghadasian, 2000).
(a)

Rats

Lymphatic recovery was studied after application of emulsions of cholesterol
and phytosterols into the stomach of thoracic duct–cannulated male rats. Recovery
from the thoracic duct was 59%, 2%, 15%, 0.5%, 3% and 0.3% for cholesterol, ȕsitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, brassicasterol and ȕ-sitostanol, respectively
(Hamada et al., 2006).
In a study with several 14C- and 3H-labelled phytosterols and phytostanols in
male and female rats, the following absorption rates were calculated, based on
recovery of radioactivity from urine, air trap, tissues and carcass. Absorption of
cholesterol in female rats was 27%. Absorption was 13% for campesterol, 4%
for ȕ-sitosterol and stigmasterol, and 1–2% for ȕ-sitostanol and campestanol.
Absorption was lower in male rats than in female rats (Sanders et al., 2000). The
Committee noted that as biliary excretion was not determined in this study, real
absorption presumably was higher than reported values.
A lower bioavailability of ȕ-sitosterol and campesterol in rats was found when
administered as water-soluble emulsified micelles compared with administration as
free phytosterols dissolved in soya bean oil (Delaney et al., 2004).
In animal studies, ȕ-sitosterol was distributed to various organs, with the
highest concentrations in the adrenal cortex, ovary and testis, and liver
(Moghadasian, 2000; Sanders et al., 2000). Rats receiving a diet containing 0.5%
phytostanols (ȕ-sitostanol/campestanol) for 4 weeks showed a 4-fold increase in
plasma levels of phytostanols and 2- to 3-fold increases in phytostanol levels in
skeletal and heart muscle (Connor et al., 2005). In rats, phytosterols are mainly
transported in blood by high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Moghadasian, 2000).
Excretion of absorbed phytosterols and phytostanols predominantly takes
place via the bile in the faeces (Sanders et al., 2000).
(b)

Humans

The systemic absorption of ȕ-sitosterol, campesterol, campestanol and ȕsitostanol was investigated in 10 healthy humans (7 females, 3 males). Phytosterols
and phytostanols derived from soya beans were deuterium-labelled and administered consecutively in two tests 2 weeks apart. Phytosterols and phytostanols
were emulsified with lecithin and administered in single-meal absorption tests.
Systemic absorption from uptake of 600 mg phytosterol or phytostanol was 1.89 ±
0.0041% for campesterol, 0.512 ± 0.038% for ȕ-sitosterol, 0.155 ± 0.0017% for

122

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

campestanol and 0.0441 ± 0.0041% for ȕ-sitostanol (Ostlund et al., 2002). The
Committee noted that the method of determination (differential determination of
substance not excreted with faeces versus determination of oral to intravenous
tracer ratios) and the form of administration may partly explain the differences in the
bioavailability compared with older studies reviewed by the Scientific Committee on
Food (2002).
Intestinal absorption of phytosterols is drastically increased in a rare autosomal recessive disease called sitosterolaemia (or phytosterolaemia). Patients
have 50- to 100-fold elevated plasma levels of phytosterols, comprising more than
10% of circulating sterols, compared with <1% under normal conditions. The
disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode for adenosine triphosphate
(ATP)-binding cassette sterol efflux transporter proteins (ABCG5 and ABCG8),
responsible for resecretion of phytosterols into the intestinal lumen. Patients
homozygous for mutations in one of the transporter genes are prone to premature
atherosclerosis, development of xanthoma and other clinical features (Chan et al.,
2006; Patel & Thompson, 2006).
In humans, phytosterols (in esterified or unesterified form) are mainly
transported in blood by LDL, in contrast to rats, where HDL is the major carrier
(Moghadasian, 2000). Unabsorbed phytosterols are excreted predominantly
unchanged with the faeces (Weststrate et al., 1999).
2.1.2 Biotransformation
A small fraction of absorbed phytosterols are transformed to polar
metabolites by the rat liver. Two metabolites have been identified as polar C21 bile
acids (Boberg et al., 1990).
2.1.3 Effects on enzymes and other biochemical parameters in vitro
Cholesterol is taken up from micelles by the transporter protein NiemannPick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) (Bradford & Awad, 2007). NPC1L1 is located on the
surface of enterocytes in the proximal jejunum. In the enterocytes, cholesterol is
esterified and transferred to chylomicrons, which then enter the systemic circulation
via lymph and blood (Bradford & Awad, 2007). The plasma cholesterol–lowering
effect of phytosterols and phytostanols is assumed to be related to the lowering of
the solubility, and hence the concentration, of cholesterol in mixed micelles in the
intestinal lumen (Plat et al., 2000). However, the lipid-lowering effect of phytosterols
and phytostanols in humans was independent of the frequency of consumption (i.e.
whether or not a daily dose was divided into several portions) (Plat & Mensink,
2005). These authors concluded that other mechanisms, such as upregulating of
efflux transporters, may also be involved in the cholesterol-lowering effect of
phytosterols and phytostanols.
Investigations with animal models, such as apo E–deficient mice, in general
showed anti-atherogenic effects, which included, among others, reduction of
atherosclerotic lesions, number of foam cells and number of cholesterol clefts
(Moghadasian, 2000; Chan et al., 2006). A recent study confirmed the reduction of
atherosclerotic lesion sizes in apo E–deficient mice (10 males per group) after

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

123

supplementation of their diet with 2% phytosterol esters for 6 months. In another
part of this study, treatment of C57/BL6 (wild-type) mice (10 males per group) for 4
weeks with 2% phytosterol esters added to the diet led to significantly reduced
endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation after induction with carbachol, but not after
induction with nitroglycerine. Cerebral lesions after experimental occlusion (30 min)
of the left filamentous middle cerebral artery were reported to be larger in the group
with phytosterol supplementation (results were presented graphically only)
(Weingärtner et al., 2008).
A cancer-protective effect has been claimed for phytosterols in humans
(Bradford & Awad, 2007). The review of data in support of this claim is beyond the
scope of this monograph.
2.2

Toxicological studies: Phytosterol esters

Data submitted to the Committee on the toxicity of phytosterol esters consist
of a series of publications (Ayesh et al., 1999; Baker et al., 1999; Hepburn et al.,
1999; Waalkens-Berendsen et al., 1999a; Weststrate et al., 1999; Sanders et al.,
2000; Wolfreys & Hepburn, 2002; Lea et al., 2004; Lea & Hepburn, 2006). These
data, in the form of original test reports, were evaluated previously by the SCF
(Scientific Committee on Food, 2000). A complete dossier containing the original
test reports was submitted by the same sponsor only very shortly before the meeting
of the Committee and could therefore not be considered exhaustively.
Phytosterol esters tested in this series were derived from vegetable oil
distillates (mainly soya bean). The main constituents were ȕ-sitosterol (45–51%),
stigmasterol (17– 23%) and campesterol (26–29%), esterified with fatty acids from
sunflower oil. If not indicated otherwise, studies discussed in this section were done
with this test material.
2.2.1 Short-term studies of toxicity
(a)

Rats

In an oral toxicity study conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom
principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and the relevant Home Office
Guidelines (not specified), Alpk:APfSD (Wistar-derived) rats (20 males and
20 females per group) were fed diets containing phytosterol esters at 0, 0.16, 1.6,
3.2 or 8.1% by weight (w/w) for 90 days. These concentrations in feed equal 0, 0.08,
0.78, 1.6 and 3.9 g phytosterol/kg body weight (bw) per day for males and 0, 0.09,
0.87, 1.8 and 4.2 g phytosterol/kg bw per day for females (mean intakes over the
study period). During the study, clinical observations, body weights, and food
and water consumption were monitored. At the end of the application period, blood
was taken under anaesthesia to determine clinical chemistry and haematological parameters. Plasma vitamin levels were not determined in this study. The rats
were killed, organ weights determined (adrenal glands, brain, epididymis, heart,
liver, kidneys, spleen, testes and thymus) and a broad range of tissues
histopathologically examined. No statistical differences in body weights or organ
weights were observed, and no clinical signs of toxicity were observed that were

124

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

attributable to the consumption of phytosterol esters. Relevant haematological
findings (statistically significantly different from control, Student’s t-test, two-sided,
1% or 5% level) consisted of a slight reduction in platelet number (at 1.6% and
3.2% in males and in all dose groups in females) and a slightly reduced prothrombin time (males: at 3.2% only; females: in all dose groups). Eosinophils were
slightly reduced in the two highest dose groups; neutrophils and lymphocytes
were slightly reduced in the highest dose group in males, but not in females.
Statistically significant findings in clinical chemistry consisted of increases in serum
activity of alkaline phosphatase (males: at 8.1% [337 International Units (IU)/l versus
234 IU/l in controls]; females: from 1.6% [166 IU/l versus 130 IU/l in controls]),
alanine aminotransferase (males: from 1.6% [51.2 IU/l versus 40.7 IU/l in controls];
females: from 3.2% [39.9 IU/l versus 30.0 IU/l in controls]) and some other changes
in the highest dose groups. There were neither macroscopic findings at necropsy
nor histological findings attributable to treatment with phytosterol esters (Horner,
1997; Hepburn et al., 1999). Based on the low degree of the changes and the
absence of any histopathological changes, the Committee concluded that these
findings were not of toxicological significance. Therefore, the no-observed-effect
level (NOEL) in this study was 8.1% phytosterol esters in the diet, equal to a dose
of 3.9 g phytosterol/kg bw per day for male rats.
Another 90-day dietary study was performed with mixtures of phytosterol
esters and phytosterol oxidation products according to United Kingdom and
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) GLP requirements and in compliance with OECD Test Guideline 408. Five groups of Wistar rats
(20 animals per dose and sex) were fed diets containing mixtures of phytosterol
esters (PE) with a phytosterol oxide concentrate (POC) at the following
concentrations: (I) 0, (II) 5.67% PE + 0.2% POC, (III) 5.67% PE + 0.6% POC,
(IV) 5.67% PE + 1.6% POC or (V) 5.67% PE only (PE control). To obtain the
phytosterol oxide concentrate, phytosterol esters were heated in the presence of
oxygen to produce a phytosterol oxide concentrate containing approximately 31%
phytosterol oxides and 19% free sterols (not further specified). The remaining 50%
consisted of unknown compounds. Throughout the study, clinical observations,
body weights, and food and water consumption were monitored. Investigations
comprised neurobehavioural testing, ophthalmoscopic examination, clinical
pathology, a renal concentrating test, gross necropsy and determination of organ
weights (adrenal gland, brain, epididymides, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, testes,
thymus, thyroid and uterus) and histopathology of a broad range of tissues. No
treatment-related clinical observations and no statistical differences in body weights
or neurobehavioural testing results were observed. Haematology revealed possible
treatment-related changes in several parameters (e.g. red blood cell count,
thrombocyte count, prothrombin time), which did not follow a clear dose–response
relationship and were partly present also in the phytosterol ester control. Alkaline
phosphatase was elevated in groups II–V. Liver weights of female rats were
increased in group IV only. No consistent macroscopic or histopathological
observations attributable to treatment were found (Lea et al., 2004). The Committee
noted that it is difficult to assess whether the observations made are attributable to
the phytosterol ester part of the applied mixture or to the oxides.

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

125

Phytosterols isolated from soya bean (approximately 49.4% ȕ-sitosterol,
27.9% campesterol, 18.5% stigmasterol), which were esterified with fatty acids
from olive oil, were administered by gavage (0, 1, 3 or 9 g/kg bw per day) to 16, 10,
10 or 16 Sprague-Dawley rats per sex, respectively, for 13 weeks. Six rats per sex
from the control and highest-dose groups were kept for 4 additional weeks
(recovery groups). During the study, which was carried out under GLP conditions
according to OECD guidelines, clinical signs, body weights, and food and water
consumption were monitored, and eyes and urine were examined. Haematology,
clinical chemistry, gross necropsy and histopathology were performed at the end
of the administration period, and organ weights were determined. Body weight gain
was decreased in male and female rats at the highest dose. Histopathological
examination showed an increased incidence of cardiomyopathy at the highest
dose in males, but not in females. Slight, but statistically significant, changes in
haematological parameters occurred at the two highest doses in both sexes. Values
were within the normal range and were reversible during the recovery period. No
other biological changes of importance were reported in this study. Based on the
effects observed at the highest dose level, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level
(LOAEL) in this study was 9 g/kg bw per day, and the no-observed-adverse-effect
level (NOAEL) was 3 g/kg bw per day (Kim et al., 2002).
2.2.2 Genotoxicity
Phytosterols and phytosterol esters were investigated in a battery of in vitro
assays (for reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in human
peripheral lymphocytes, gene mutations in mouse lymphoma cells). Furthermore,
two in vivo assays were applied: the bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats and
the rat liver assay for unscheduled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Studies
were carried out according to OECD Test Guidelines 471, 473, 474, 476 and 486.
Neither of the test materials showed genotoxic activity in any of the tests (Wolfreys
& Hepburn, 2002) (Table 1).
Lea et al. (2004) tested the phytosterol oxide concentrate described
above in a series of in vitro genotoxicity tests (mutations in bacteria, chromosomal
aberrations and micronucleus induction in mammalian cells). Testing was performed in compliance with United Kingdom and OECD GLP requirements. The
bacterial reverse mutation assays were performed according to OECD Test
Guideline 471, and the test for chromosomal aberrations was conducted according
to OECD Test Guideline 473. No genotoxic activity was observed in either of the
tests (Table 1).
Two types of oxidation products (triols and epoxides) of a mixture of ȕsitosterol and campesterol were synthesized, purified and administered once
intraperitoneally to mice to investigate their genotoxicity in a flow cytometer–based
in vivo micronucleus assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observable up to the
highest dose tested—i.e. 67 mg/kg bw for epoxides and 9.4 mg/kg bw for triols
(Abramsson-Zetterberg et al., 2007) (Table 1).

2.2.3 Reproductive toxicity
(a)

Rats

In a reproductive toxicity study performed according to OECD Test Guideline
416 in accordance with GLP, 28 Wistar outbred (Crl:(WI)WU BR) rats per dose
and sex were fed, over two successive generations, diets containing phytosterol
esters at levels of 0, 1.6, 3.2 and 8.1% (w/w), equal to 0, 0.5– 2.3, 0.9–4.5 and
2.3–12.6 g phytosterol esters/kg bw per day, respectively (ranges of weekly
averages), depending on the administration period. Females were treated during a
10-week premating period, the mating period (up to 3 weeks) and gestation until
weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21). Males were treated only during the premating
period. Twenty-eight male and female pups per group were selected randomly from
litters produced to form the F1 generation, which was treated analogously. A
wide range of reproductive and developmental parameters, including sexual
maturation parameters and estrous cycle length, were investigated. Macroscopic
and microscopic examinations included a histological examination of selected
organs from F1 and F2 weanlings and from F0 and F1 parental animals. Reproductive
performance was determined by measuring precoital time, mating index, male and
female fertility index, female fecundity index, gestation index and time, and postimplantation losses. Developmental toxicity was assessed by measuring number of
pups, the live birth index, pup mortality and viability, and the sex ratio. Clinical
observations did not reveal any unusual findings. Fertility was unaffected. Food
consumption, food efficiency and body weight gain of male and female animals of
the high-dose F0 and F1 groups were slightly, but significantly, decreased. There
were no treatment-related histopathological effects on organs examined. Pup
weights of both generations were unaffected (data shown in the test report only).
The viability index at day 4 for the pups from both the F0 (all dose levels) and the
F1 (two highest doses) generations was slightly, but significantly, decreased.

128

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

However, no differences in pup mortality were observable when analysed on a litter
basis (Waalkens-Berendsen & Wolterbeek, 1998; Waalkens-Berendsen et al.,
1999a). A NOEL of 8.1% phytosterol esters in the diet can be derived from this study.
This concentration in the diet equals a range of 3.3–6.5 g phytosterol esters/kg bw
per day for F0 and F1 females during premating (10 weeks) and 2.3–3.8 g phytosterol
esters/kg bw per day during gestation (3 weeks). A time-weighted average for these
exposure periods is 4.4 g phytosterol esters/kg bw per day, which corresponds to
2.7 g phytosterols/kg bw per day.
(b)

Minks

In a limited, non-guideline study, the reproductive toxicity of ȕ-sitosterol at
low doses was investigated in the American mink. Sixty minks (7 weeks old) per
group and sex received ȕ-sitosterol at 0, 5, 10 or 50 mg/kg bw per day for 10 months.
After 3 months of exposure, 15 males per group were killed and investigated for
organ weights and haematological and clinical chemistry parameters. Selection was
non-randomized: smaller animals with low fur quality were preferred. The authors
reported differences in body fat masses (omental, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, intraabdominal fat), but increases in fat masses were not dose dependent, and no
experimental details on the determination of fat masses were given. In the second
part of the study, after 7 months of exposure, male (“top-rated”) animals (10–11 per
group) were mated with 4–5 females each. Reproductive parameters (number of
pregnant females, litter and kit numbers, postnatal mortality and development)
measured did not reveal any treatment-related changes (Nieminen et al., 2008).
2.2.4 Special studies on estrogenic activity
In older studies with parenteral application, some estrogenic activity of
phytosterols was observed (Scientific Committee on Food, 2000). This raised
concerns that estrogenic activity may also be present after oral uptake and that
uptake from food may exert effects on the hormonal system in humans.
The possible estrogenicity of phytosterols and phytosterol esters was
investigated in a series of in vitro (competitive estrogen receptor binding assay,
recombinant yeast assay) and in vivo test systems (immature rat uterotrophic
assay). The competitive estrogen receptor binding assay uses a preparation of
estrogen receptors isolated from rat uteri and measures the concentrationdependent substitution of [2,4,5,6-3H]estradiol at the estrogen receptor. In this
assay, a mixture of phytosterols failed to compete for binding at the estrogen
receptor when tested in concentrations up to 1 × 10í4 mol/l. The recombinant yeast
assay is an assay to measure estrogen-induced expression of reporter genes in
yeast. The assay is therefore able to detect the stimulation by test compounds of
the transcription of the human estrogen receptor. When tested in concentrations up
to 2 × 10í4 mol/l, phytosterols did not stimulate the transcriptional activation of the
human estrogen receptor. In the uterotrophic assay, phytosterols were administered
by gavage on 3 consecutive days to 22- to 23-day-old rats followed by determination
of absolute uterus weights on day 4. Groups of 10 animals received a single dose
of phytosterols or phytosterol esters of 0, 5, 50 or 500 mg/kg bw. Treatment with

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

129

phytosterols or phytosterol esters at any dose level did not show an effect on uterine
weight (Baker et al., 1999).
The hormonal activity of the pure substances ȕ-sitosterol, stigmasterol and
their purified chlorine dioxide oxidation products was assessed in vitro and in vivo.
Neither the parent compounds nor the oxidation products showed relevant activity
in the estrogen receptor binding assay in vitro. In the androgen receptor binding
assay, the phytosterols and their oxidation products showed a small but measurable
activity. ȕ-Sitosterol, stigmasterol and their oxidation products were inactive in the
28-day masculinization assay with mosquitofish at concentrations up to 100 μg/l
(van den Heuvel et al., 2006).
2.3

Toxicological studies: Phytostanol–phytosterol mixtures

A submission was made to the Committee, consisting of toxicity studies on
mixtures of unesterified phytosterols and phytostanols. In 2000, the technical manufacturing process changed from solvent extraction to vacuum distillation, which
resulted in a change in composition. Mixtures of phytosterols and phytostanols
derived from solvent extraction (MPSS-SE), which were used for toxicity studies,
consisted of about 40– 55% ȕ-sitosterol, 16–31% ȕ-sitostanol, 11–15% campesterol
and 2–11% campestanol. A mixture derived from vacuum distillation (MPSS–VD)
between 2000 and 2003 and used for a repeated-dose toxicity study contained
63.5% ȕ-sitosterol, 21.7% ȕ-sitostanol, 6.5% campesterol and 2.8% campestanol.
If not indicated otherwise, studies discussed in this section were done with these
mixtures, which were derived from tall oil. Data provided by the sponsor show that
mixtures obtained from vacuum distillation after 2003 contain higher percentages
of ȕ-sitosterol (approximately 73%).
2.3.1 Short-term studies of toxicity
Both MPSS-SE and MPSS-VD have been investigated in 90-day oral toxicity
studies. In a dietary toxicity study with Crl:CD Sprague-Dawley rats performed in
compliance with USFDA GLP regulations, 0, 1.25, 2.5 or 5% MPSS-SE in the diet,
equal to 0, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.2 g test material/kg bw per day for males and 0, 1.2, 2.4
and 4.8 g test material/kg bw per day for females (mean intakes over the study
period), were administered to 20 animals per group and sex for at least 91 days.
Four additional animals per sex and group were used for toxicokinetic studies
(analysis of test material in serum and determination of total cholesterol and
triglycerides during the treatment period). Body weights and food consumption
were measured and clinical observations were made during the treatment
period. Investigations comprised ophthalmological examinations, haematology and
serum chemistry evaluation, urinalysis, sperm analysis and determination of
vitamins A, D, E and K and ȕ-carotene in serum. After treatment, all animals were
necropsied. Organ weights were determined, and organs (all tissues of control and
high-dose animals) were examined histopathologically. No treatment-related effects
regarding body weights, haematology, urinalysis or clinical chemistry parameters
or in histopathological investigations were observed. Serum levels of “total
phytosterols” (sum of ȕ-sitosterol, ȕ-sitostanol, campesterol and campestanol) were
increased during the study about 2- to 3-fold, but did not show clear dose

130

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

dependency and reached statistical significance only for the 1.25% female dose
group at the end of treatment. Serum vitamin A and E levels were unaffected by
treatment, and concentrations of vitamins D and K and ȕ-carotene in serum were
below the respective limits of detection. Inflammation of the caecum, colon and
rectum was slightly more frequent and severe in treated males compared with
controls. However, this observation showed no dose dependency and was absent
in female rats (an opposite trend was observed in high-dose females, where
inflammation of the large intestine was less than in controls). The NOEL in this study
is 5% MPSS-SE in the diet, which, according to the authors, equals 4.2 g/kg bw per
day for males and 4.8 g/kg bw per day for females (Wedig, 2000).
After the change in the manufacturing process, MPSS-VD was investigated
in a 90-day dietary study in rats conducted according to OECD Test Guideline
408 and in compliance with OECD GLP principles. Concentrations of 0, 1.25, 2.5
or 5% MPSS-VD in the diet, equal to 0, 0.99, 2.0 and 4.1 g test material/kg bw
per day for males and 0, 1.1, 2.2 and 4.6 g test material/kg bw per day for females
(mean intakes over the study period), were administered to 20 Sprague-Dawley rats
per group and sex for at least 90 days. Investigations included measurement of body
weights and food consumption and clinical and neurobehavioural observations
during the study, ophthalmological examination before and after treatment,
urinalysis, and measurement of haematological and clinical chemistry parameters.
Organ weights were determined, and organs (tissues of control and high-dose
animals) were examined histopathologically. Furthermore, animals were subjected
to a battery of functional and motor activity tests before and after treatment. Plasma
vitamin levels were not determined in this study. No consistent treatment-related
changes in any of these parameters were observed, apart from the transient
occurrence of red mucous membranes in 3, 6, 7 and 12 of 20 male rats and 1, 10,
6 and 17 of 20 female rats at dose levels of 0, 1.25, 2.5 and 5% MPSS-VD,
respectively. Also, some statistically significant differences in clinical chemistry
parameters between treated and untreated animals were observed in female, but
not in male, animals. In female rats, serum alanine aminotransferase and Ȗ-glutamyl
transferase activities were increased at 2.5% and 5% MPSS-VD (without clear dose
dependency), urea concentration was increased at the highest dose and albumin
was decreased in the low- and mid-dose groups. Whereas these observations may
be an early indication of effects in the liver, no changes were observed in the liver
in the histopathological investigations. The NOEL in this study is 5% MPSS-VD in
the diet, which, according to the authors, equals 4.1 g/kg bw per day for males and
4.6 g/kg bw per day for females (Robbins, 2002).
2.3.2 Genotoxicity
Mixtures of phytostanols and phytosterols derived from both solvent
extraction (MPSS-SE) and vacuum distillation (MPSS-VD) were examined in a
series of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. All studies were conducted in
compliance with OECD principles of GLP. Studies on MPSS-VD by Krul & van
Ommen (2001) and de Vogel (2001) were carried out according to OECD Test
Guidelines 471 and 473, respectively. No genotoxic activity of any of the mixtures
was observed in these studies, which are summarized in Table 2.

2.3.3 Reproductive toxicity
(a)

Mice

No reproductive toxicity study was submitted for the mixtures of phytosterols
and phytostanols discussed above (MPSS-SE, MPSS-VD). The developmental
toxicity of a mixture of phytosterols and phytostanols was investigated in a limited,
non-guideline multigenerational study with mice at a single low dose. A mixture of
ȕ-sitosterol (75.7%), ȕ-sitostanol (13%), campesterol (9%) and artenols (0.9%) was
applied at a dose level of 0 or 5 mg/kg bw per day in the diet to 10 male and 10
female mice (F0) per group and, consecutively, to four generations of offspring
(similar group sizes). No information was given with respect to the length of the

132

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

premating exposure period. Reproductive parameters (e.g. number of pregnant
females, number of pups) and postnatal development (e.g. pup mortality, pup body
weights) as well as sex organ weights and sex hormone levels were monitored in
the F1 to F4 generations. The authors reported changes in testosterone plasma and
testicular levels and relative uterine weights in some generations. However,
changes were not consistent over generations, and, because of the single dose
design, no dose–response effect could be detected. No effects on number or
viability of pups or other overt signs of developmental toxicity were observed
(Ryökkynen et al., 2005).
2.3.4 Special studies on estrogenic activity
The estrogenic activity of MPSS-SE was assessed in the immature rat
uterotrophic assay. Doses of 0, 500, 1000 or 2500 mg MPSS-SE/kg bw were
administered via gavage twice daily to 10 immature (19 days old) female rats
(Crl:CD (SD)IGS BR VAF/Plus) for 4 consecutive days, yielding daily doses of 0,
1000, 2000 and 5000 mg/kg bw. Ethinyl estradiol was used as a positive control.
Body weight gains of animals in the 2000 and 5000 mg/kg bw per day groups were
significantly reduced. Absolute and relative uterine weights were unaffected in
treated animals compared with the negative control (Dearlove, 2000).
2.4

Toxicological studies: Phytostanol esters

A set of toxicity studies with phytostanol esters, conducted according to
recent guidelines and under GLP conditions, was submitted to the Committee. The
same data set was previously submitted to the USFDA together with human
intervention studies. Based on these data, phytostanol esters in the USA gained the
status of GRAS substances in 1999 (Food Master File 000626).1 Results from these
toxicological studies were also published in peer-reviewed journals (Slesinski et al.,
1999; Turnbull et al., 1999a, 1999b, 1999c; Whittaker et al., 1999).
Two types of test samples were investigated in the toxicological studies
submitted: 1) wood-derived mixtures of phytostanol esters (WDPSE) (with a stanol
composition of about 94% ȕ-sitostanol and about 6% campestanol) and 2)
vegetable oil–derived mixtures of phytostanol esters (VODPSE) (with a stanol
composition of about 68% ȕ-sitostanol and about 32% campestanol). If not indicated
otherwise, studies discussed in this section were done with these two test materials.
According to the sponsor, this range of phytostanol ester compositions represents
the mixtures used commercially.
2.4.1 Acute toxicity
(a)

Acute oral and dermal toxicity

Both WDPSE and VODPSE were investigated for acute oral and dermal
toxicity. Oral toxicity testing was carried out in compliance with OECD Test
1

Information on GRAS for phytostanol esters is available online at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/
dockets/dockets/95s0316/rpt0054_01.pdf.

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

133

Guidelines 401 and 423 (Acute Toxic Class Method) in a limit test with three male
and three female rats at 2000 mg/kg bw. None of the stanol ester mixtures caused
lethal effects, and no clinical signs were observed (with the exception of one male
rat dosed with WDPSE that showed diarrhoea). Based on these results, the median
lethal dose (LD50) was concluded to exceed 2000 mg/kg bw for both mixtures (Appel,
1998a, 1998e).
The dermal toxicity of both mixtures was investigated in rat studies in compliance with OECD Test Guideline 402. A dose of 2000 mg test substance/kg bw in
maize oil was applied dermally to five male and five female rats for 24 h. No deaths
or clinical signs of toxicity were observed after application of WDPSE. After
VODPSE application, one male rat died during the 14-day observation period.
Dermal LD50 values were considered to exceed 2000 mg/kg bw for both mixtures
(Appel, 1998b, 1998f).
(b)

Skin irritation and corrosion

Skin irritation/corrosion was tested in studies with male albino rabbits in
compliance with OECD Test Guideline 404. A dose of 2000 mg/kg bw was applied
to the clipped skin of three rabbits for 4 h under semi-occlusive conditions. WDPSE
did not cause any skin effects and was considered non-irritating to skin. VODPSE
caused very slight erythema after 1 h of treatment, which was completely reversible
within 24 h after treatment (Appel, 1998c, 1998g).
(c)

Eye irritation

Prior to in vivo eye irritation testing in compliance with OECD Test Guideline
405 (Draize test) with albino rabbits, a screening was performed using a non-GLP
(ex vivo) chicken enucleated eye test. Both mixtures did not reveal irritating potential
in the chicken enucleated eye test. In the rabbit eye in vivo, WDPSE and VODPSE
caused slight and slight or moderate discharge, respectively, which was reversible
within 24 h after treatment. Both mixtures were considered minimally irritating to
rabbit eyes (Appel, 1998d, 1998h).
(d)

Skin sensitization

Possible skin sensitizing properties were investigated in maximization tests
in guinea-pigs in compliance with OECD Test Guideline 406. Neither WDPSE nor
VODPSE caused signs of skin sensitization after application (in induction and
challenge phase) to 10 male guinea-pigs (Prinsen, 1998a, 1998b).
2.4.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
(a)

Rats

In a 90-day oral toxicity study performed according to OECD Test Guideline
408 and in compliance with OECD GLP principles, Wistar rats (20 animals per group
and sex) received 0, 0.34, 1.7 or 8.4% (w/w) of WDPSE in the feed (corresponding
to 0, 0.2, 1 and 5% of phytostanols in the feed) for a period of 13 weeks. Three other

134

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

groups (20 animals per group and sex) received 0, 0.36, 1.8 and 8.9% (w/w) of
VODPSE, which correspond to the same levels of phytostanols in the feed as with
WDPSE: 0, 0.2, 1 and 5%. Intake of WDPSE was 0, 0.17, 0.87 and 4.6 g/kg bw per
day for males and 0, 0.19, 0.98 and 5.1 g/kg bw per day for females (mean intakes
over the study period). Intake of VODPSE was 0, 0.19, 0.94 and 4.9 g/kg bw per
day for males and 0, 0.21, 1.1 and 5.5 g/kg bw per day for females (mean intakes
over the study period). This corresponds to intake levels of phytostanols for both
test materials of 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.7 g/kg bw per day for males and 0, 0.1, 0.6 and
3.0 g/kg bw per day for females. Parameters examined in this study included growth,
food and water consumption, food conversion efficiency, haematology, clinical
chemistry, urinalysis, plasma levels of fat-soluble vitamins, estrous cycle length,
faecal neutral steroid and bile acid levels, serum sterol and stanol levels, organ
weights, and gross and microscopic pathology. Daily clinical observations were
made, ophthalmoscopic examinations were performed in the last week of the study,
and gross and microscopic organ and tissue examinations were performed at
autopsy.
Absolute kidney weights in male, but not female, rats at the highest dose
for both WDPSE and VODPSE were slightly (8–9%), but significantly, reduced.
Absolute and relative liver weights were reduced in all treated males (change in
absolute liver weights 5–13%, statistically significant with the exception of the
VODPSE low-dose group). The only treatment-related finding upon histopathological examination was a slightly more pronounced depletion of glycogen in all
treated male rats. In haematological examinations, female rats of the highest
VODPSE dose group showed significant shifts in the percentage of neutrophils
(increase) and lymphocytes (decrease). Thrombocyte count was significantly
increased in female rats of the high-dose WDPSE group. Plasma concentrations of
vitamins E (Į-tocopherol), D (25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol) and K1 (phylloquinone)
were decreased in both sexes at the highest dose of both test materials. Plasma
concentrations of vitamin A and ȕ-carotene were unaffected at all dietary
concentrations (Table 3). Clinical chemistry analysis showed the following
treatment-related changes: alkaline phosphatase plasma activity was elevated in
VODPSE high-dose females, albumin concentration was decreased in VODPSE
(low- and middle-dose) and WDPSE (high-dose) females, and total protein was
decreased in WDPSE males (middle- and high-dose) and females (high-dose)
(Jonker, 1998).
Based on the low degree of the changes in haematological and clinical
chemistry parameters and the absence of significant histopathological changes, the
Committee concluded that these findings were not of toxicological significance. The
most prominent effects observed in this study were changes of vitamin plasma
levels at dietary concentrations of 1.7% WDPSE and 1.8% VODPSE, which both
correspond to 1% phytostanols in food, equal to 0.5 g phytostanols/kg bw per day.
As discussed below, corresponding effects on concentrations of vitamin A, D or K
were not observed in human studies with up to 1 year of exposure. Therefore, the
Committee concluded that these effects were of unclear human relevance and are
not to be considered further in this evaluation.

2.4.3 Genotoxicity
Phytostanol esters from both wood (WDPSE) and vegetable oil (VODPSE)
were investigated in vitro in bacterial systems and mammalian cells for genotoxic
effects. Studies were carried out according to OECD Test Guidelines 471, 473 and
476. No genotoxic activity of any of the mixtures was observed in these studies,
which are summarized in Table 4.

2.4.4 Reproductive toxicity
(a)

Rats

In a two-generation reproductive toxicity study performed according to
OECD Test Guideline 416, groups of 28 Wistar rats (Crl:(WI)WU BR) per dose and
sex were administered diets containing 0, 1.75, 4.38 or 8.76% VODPSE
(corresponding to 0, 1, 2.5 or 5% phytostanols). Intakes of phytostanols in F0 and
F1 were 0.6–1.3, 0.4–0.7 and 1.0–2.1 g/kg bw per day for the low dose group
females during premating, gestation and lactation, respectively (ranges of weekly
averages). For the middle-dose females, intake levels were 1.5–3.4, 1.0–1.7 and
2.5–5.6 g/kg bw per day during premating, gestation and lactation, respectively. For
high-dose females, intake levels were 3.2–7.3, 2.1–3.6 and 5.2–11.1 g/kg bw per
day during premating, gestation and lactation, respectively. Intakes by F0 and F1
males during premating were 0.5–1.4, 1.3–3.5 and 2.8–7.7 g/kg bw per day for low-,
middle- and high-dose animals, respectively. Females of the parent generation were
exposed 10 weeks prior to mating, during mating and gestation up to weaning (PND
21). Males were exposed during the premating (10 weeks) and mating period (up
to 3 weeks) and then sacrificed. To form the F1 generation, on day 21, 28 animals

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

137

per sex per dose group were selected at random and fed the same dietary
concentrations as their parents. The same procedure that was followed for the F1
group was followed for raising the F2 generation. Body weights of F0 and F1 animals,
food consumption, reproductive performance parameters (e.g. females pregnant,
fertility indices, implantation losses) and developmental toxicity parameters (e.g.
litter numbers, pup numbers, viability indices, sex ratio) were investigated.
Macroscopic postmortem examinations were performed on all animals of the F0 and
F1 generation, and selected organs of animals from the control and high-dose
groups were examined microscopically.
Food consumption was increased at the middle and high dose levels. Body
weights of female animals were not affected by treatment. No treatment-related
effects on reproductive performance were observed. Reproductive organ weights
were also unaffected. With respect to developmental toxicity parameters, the only
significant treatment-related effects concerned decreased pup body weights of both
the F0 and F1 generations in the high-dose group on PND 14 and PND 21
(Waalkens-Berendsen et al., 1999b) (Table 5). According to the authors of the study,
the reduced pup weight may have been caused by the reduction in the caloric value
of the diet. A NOAEL for reproductive and developmental toxicity of 4.38% VODPSE
(or 2.5% phytostanols) in the diet can be derived from this study. This dietary
concentration equals 1.8–9.8 g VODPSE/kg bw per day, corresponding to an intake
of 1.0–5.6 g phytostanols/kg bw per day. As reduced pup weights were not observed
before PND 14 and exposure levels were higher during lactation (2.5–5.6 g
phytostanols/kg bw per day) than during other exposure periods, the Committee
concluded that the NOAEL of this study can be set based on the exposure level
during lactation, which averaged 4.1 g phytostanols/kg bw per day. The LOAEL in
this study was concluded to be 8.1 g phytostanols/kg bw per day (average exposure
during lactation at the highest concentration tested).
This study contained five satellite groups (10 animals per sex per group),
which received VODPSE in the diet at levels of 0, 2, 2.5, 3 or 4% for 94 days. Plasma
levels of vitamins E and K1 were significantly decreased at all dose levels in both
sexes; those of vitamin A were significantly decreased at all dose levels in males
only. Vitamin D concentrations were decreased in males at 2.5–4% VODPSE.
A prenatal developmental toxicity study conducted according to OECD Test
Guideline 414 was performed with VODPSE. The test material was administered in
the diet to 28 mated female Wistar rats (HsdCpb:WU) per group during gestation
days 0–21 at concentrations of 0, 1.75, 4.38 and 8.76% phytostanol esters, which
correspond to concentrations in the diet of 0, 1, 2.5 and 5% phytostanols. End-points
investigated included, among others, numbers of animals pregnant, corpora lutea,
implantations, live and dead fetuses, early or late resorptions, and pre- or postimplantation losses, fetal body weight, sex ratio, placental weight, external
appearance, and visceral and skeletal examinations for malformations, anomalies
or variations. In the high-dose group, maternal body weights were significantly
reduced (about 3%) on gestation days 7 and 14, but not on gestation day 21. No
significant observation related to treatment was made with respect to malformations
or for any of the developmental toxicity parameters (Waalkens-Berendsen, 1998).
A NOEL for developmental toxicity of 5% phytostanols in the diet can be derived
from this study, which is equal to 3.2 g phytostanols/kg bw per day, the average of
weekly intakes given by the authors for the exposure period from gestation days
0 to 21.

2.4.5 Special studies on estrogenic activity
The potential estrogenic activity of four mixtures of phytostanols, derived
from vegetable oil, was tested in vitro. The relative percentage of ȕ-sitostanol in the
mixtures varied from 58% to 67%, and the percentage of campestanol varied from
29% to 32%. The phytosterol content was below 4%. Estrogenic activity was
measured as the ability to induce proliferation of human mammary adenocarcinoma
(MCF-7) cells. Proliferation was measured by staining the cells with the protein stain
sulforhodamine B and measuring the optical density (modified E-screen test).
MCF-7 cells were cultured for 6 days with 0, 1, 10 or 100 μmol phytostanol mixture/l.

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

139

17ȕ-Estradiol was used as a positive control. Precipitation and slight cytotoxicity
were observed at the highest concentration with all mixtures. No cell proliferation
was observable in cells treated with phytostanols. Under the conditions of this study,
the phytostanol mixtures tested showed no estrogenic activity (Leeman, 1998).
The uterotrophic activity of WDPSE and VODPSE was investigated in vivo
in a short-term test with young female rats (aged 17 days) (Tiecco test). Groups of
10 female Wistar rats were fed diets containing 0% or 8.3% WDPSE or 8.3%
VODPSE for 4 days. Diethylstilbestrol at concentrations of 5, 10 or 20 μg/kg in the
diet was used as positive control. Uterus weight was used as an indicator of
estrogenic activity. No treatment-related effects on the animals’ general condition,
body weight or food consumption were observed. Neither WDPSE nor VODPSE
treatment influenced the uterus weights of the animals at the end of the treatment
period (Jonker, 1997).
2.5

Observations in humans

2.5.1 Lipid-lowering effect
The lipid-lowering effect of phytosterols and phytostanols was investigated
in numerous human studies. In 2001, 32 experts convened in Stresa, Italy, to
discuss the outcome of 42 human randomized, placebo-controlled trials available
up to then (Katan et al., 2003). Study duration was typically several weeks, and
doses of phytosterols or phytostanols (either esterified or in free form) were up to
3.4 g/day. In an analysis of the pooled data, the authors concluded that at mean
doses of 2.5 g stanols/day and 2.3 g sterols/day, LDL cholesterol decreased in
adults by 10.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.9–11.3%) and 9.7% (95% CI =
8.5–10.8%), respectively, with no statistical differences in the effect of phytosterols
compared with phytostanols. In agreement with older studies, the dose–effect
relationship reached a plateau at intake levels of about 2 g/day, with higher doses
showing no increased effect. The SCF concluded from studies reviewed that the
“blood [total cholesterol- and LDL cholesterol-]lowering effect of sterols and stanols
is quite similar, although the hydrogenated sterol esters may be somehow more
efficient in reducing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol” (Scientific Committee
on Food, 2002).
2.5.2 Effects on vitamins and carotenoids
Several human studies showed that ingestion of phytosterols and
phytostanols led to reduced serum levels of carotenoids, but not retinol (vitamin A).
It is assumed that, as with cholesterol, the concentration of other lipophilic
compounds such as provitamins and antioxidants in mixed micelles and
consequently their uptake are reduced by phytosterols and phytostanols (Plat &
Mensink, 2005). As carotenoids and tocopherols in blood are mainly bound to HDL,
LDL and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), their serum concentrations are often
adjusted to lipid content (either as blood total cholesterol or as LDL cholesterol
levels) to account for changes in their carriers. Decreases in serum carotenoids and
Į-tocopherol observed in these studies generally disappeared after standardization
for lipid content, with the exception of ȕ-carotene.

140

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

In a study submitted to the SCF, healthy human volunteers consumed 20 g
fat spread per day containing 8% phytosterols for 1 year. After adjustment for lipid
content, the only significant change consisted of a decrease in ȕ-carotene (21%
compared with the baseline at the start of the study). This decrease occurred despite
the fact that the fat spread was supplemented with 50 mg carotenoids/kg fat (mainly
ȕ-carotene and lycopene added for coloration) (Scientific Committee on Food,
2000).
In a review, 18 human studies were evaluated for observations regarding
effects of phytosterols and phytostanols on serum levels of (pro)vitamins. After
consumption of 1.5 g/day or more, absolute serum concentrations of Į-carotene,
ȕ-carotene, lycopene and Į-tocopherol were decreased by 9%, 20%, 7% and 6%,
respectively. Only ȕ-carotene remained statistically significantly decreased after
adjustment for change in total serum cholesterol. On average, levels of vitamins D
and A were not different between subjects consuming phytosterols or phytostanols
and controls. Vitamin K–dependent clotting factors were not influenced by
consumption of phytostanols (Katan et al., 2003). Interestingly, a meta-analysis
based on standardized data available in the literature concluded that the decrease
in plasma ȕ-carotene levels plateaus when the daily intake of phytosterols and
phytostanols reaches 2.2 g (Plat et al., 2000).
In addition to the beneficial effects on lipid concentrations summarized
above, some of the new placebo-controlled human trials also investigated
potentially harmful effects on (pro)vitamins and other parameters. Effects on
carotenoid and tocopherol levels observed in these studies are summarized in Table
6. Some of the studies in addition investigated possible effects on plasma
concentrations of vitamins D and K. Levels of these vitamins were not influenced
by consumption of phytosterols or phytostanols (Raeini-Sarjaz et al., 2002; Korpela
et al., 2006).
As with the older studies, effects on most (pro)vitamins in the new studies
(see Table 6) diminished when concentrations were lipid adjusted. In a 1-year study,
serum concentrations of Į-carotene, ȕ-carotene, Į-tocopherol and lycopene were
lower after phytosterol consumption (1.7 g phytosterols/day as esters in fat spread),
compared with controls. Į-Carotene concentrations after 52 weeks, but not ȕcarotene levels, remained statistically significantly lower in the exposed group,
when expressed per millimole LDL cholesterol, compared with the placebo control.
Also, differential decreases in Į- and ȕ-carotene concentrations per time between
weeks 0 and 52 were significantly lower compared with controls, with or without
adjustment to changes in LDL cholesterol. Within the study period, lipid-adjusted
concentrations of Į- and ȕ-carotene decreased by 4% and 28%, respectively. No
differences in levels of vitamins A, B12 and K1 and folic acid were observed between
persons consuming phytosterol-enriched fat spread and those consuming control
spread (Hendriks et al., 2003). Another study investigated the effect on carotenoid
levels after long-term (1-year) administration of sitostanol esters in margarine to
humans. In this study, absolute plasma levels of Į-carotene, ȕ-carotene and Įtocopherol were significantly reduced in 102 individuals with moderate
hypercholesterolaemia after ingestion of sitostanol esters (equivalent to 3.0 g ȕsitostanol/day) in margarine. After normalization to cholesterol concentration, only
reduction of ȕ-carotene (33%) remained statistically significant (Gylling et al., 1999).

In a single-blind study, 35 mildly hypercholesterolaemic subjects consumed
high levels of phytosterol esters in fat spread and muesli for 6 weeks. Total
consumption at full compliance summed up to 6.6 g phytosterols/day. Baseline
measurements of serum lipids, phytosterols, carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins
in plasma were undertaken during a 2-week baseline period preceding the
treatment. Cholesterol-adjusted plasma concentrations of Į-carotene, ȕ-carotene,
lutein and lycopene decreased by 20%, 26%, 14% and 11%, respectively,
compared with baseline. Lutein and Į-carotene concentrations, but not ȕ-carotene
concentrations, increased significantly upon diet supplementation with fruits and
vegetables. Carotenoid-lowering effects were partly reversible during a 2-week
wash-out period. Vitamin A and D levels were not affected by phytosterol ester
treatment. After the consumption of the high phytosterol ester diet, ȕ-sitosterol and
campesterol plasma concentrations were increased by 45% and 105%, respectively
(Clifton et al., 2004).
A study investigated whether increased ȕ-carotene intake is able to impede
the decrease of ȕ-carotene plasma levels induced by phytosterol uptake. In a
double-blinded cross-over study with 46 individuals, whose diet was supplemented
with fruits and vegetables, ȕ-carotene plasma levels of individuals receiving 2.3 g
phytosterol esters per day or 2.5 g phytostanol esters per day were similar to those
of controls when ȕ-carotene levels were normalized to blood lipids, but not with
absolute plasma levels (Noakes et al., 2002).
No differences in plasma levels of ȕ-carotene, Į-tocopherol or other
antioxidants were detected between a control group and a group ingesting 3.2 g
phytosterols/day as phytosterol esters in bakery products enriched with Įtocopherol (5.3 mg/day) and ȕ-carotene (0.9 mg/day) for 8 weeks. In this study,
consumption of phytosterol esters increased ȕ-sitosterol plasma levels by 89%
(Quílez et al., 2003).
2.5.3 Association with atherosclerosis
The observation that increased uptake and plasma levels of phytosterols
lead to premature atherosclerosis in patients with phytosterolaemia raised concerns
about a possible atherosclerotic activity of phytosterols in the general population
(Patel & Thompson, 2006; John et al., 2007).
In a review of 45 studies (population-based studies and clinical trials),
baseline plasma concentrations of phytosterols were derived. Plasma concentrations ranged between 2.8 and 16.0 μmol/l (mean 7.9 ± 2.7 μmol/l) for ȕ-sitosterol
and between 6.9 and 27.9 μmol/l (mean 14.2 ± 5 μmol/l) for campesterol. From a
subset of these studies, the authors concluded that supplementing the diet with
1.8–2 g phytosterols/day for 4–8 weeks results in a 52–99% increase in campesterol
levels and in a 23–93% increase in ȕ-sitosterol levels. Supplementation of the diet
with phytostanols at dose levels of 1.5–3 g/day decreased phytosterol plasma
concentrations (Chan et al., 2006).
An analysis of 11 clinical trials with consumption of phytosterols in fat
spread in a range of 1.6–3.3 g/day revealed increases of campesterol in plasma of
30–120% (with one exception, where a phytosterol mixture containing only low

146

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

levels of campesterol was used) and of ȕ-sitosterol levels of 16–75% (Kritchevsky
& Chen, 2005).
Results from a post-launch monitoring study in the Netherlands were in
agreement with these observations. Long-time users of food items supplemented
with phytosterols (n = 67) or with phytostanols (n = 13) were investigated and
compared with non-users. Intake of 1.1 g phytosterols/day over 5 years led to an
increase in cholesterol-adjusted serum ȕ-sitosterol and campesterol concentrations
by 22% and 103%, respectively. A mean phytostanol intake of 0.6 g/day resulted in
elevations of serum ȕ-sitostanol and campestanol levels by 197% and 196%,
respectively (Fransen et al., 2007).
In a study published as a “preliminary report”, a small group of patients
submitted to hospital for artery coronary bypass graft operation was investigated.
The study group was divided in subgroups, which either had (n = 26) or did not have
(n = 27) a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD). Serum campesterol and
ȕ-sitosterol levels differed significantly between groups, although absolute
differences were small (patients with CHD family history had about 30% higher ȕsitosterol and campesterol plasma concentrations). Differences between groups
were also significantly different for campesterol/cholesterol and ȕ-sitosterol/
cholesterol ratios. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were not different between
groups (Sudhop et al., 2002).
As part of the Prospective Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) study, a
nested case–control study was performed in Germany. One hundred and fifty-nine
men with myocardial infarction or sudden coronary death in the last 10 years were
compared with 318 controls matched for age, smoking status and date of
investigation. Baseline plasma samples at the start of the study were obtained,
stored and analysed retrospectively. Plasma ȕ-sitosterol, but not campesterol,
concentrations were higher in cases than in controls. Triglycerides, total cholesterol
and LDL cholesterol were also higher and HDL cholesterol was lower in cases than
in controls. When ȕ-sitosterol was normalized to cholesterol (ȕ-sitosterol/cholesterol
ratio), no significant difference was observed between groups. Only if cases were
further stratified did the ȕ-sitosterol/cholesterol ratio show a significant difference
for the high-CHD subgroup, but not for the lower-risk subgroups. No multivariate
analysis was performed to discriminate between the various parameters (Assmann
et al., 2006).
Results of the population-based MONICA/KORA follow-up study were
recently published as a conference contribution. In this prospective cohort study,
1186 male (randomly sampled) residents of southern Germany were followed from
1994 to 2005. Serum concentrations of campesterol and other sterols were
analysed. In the observation period, there were 49 incident cases of (fatal or nonfatal) CHD. After multivariable adjustment for CHD risk factors (such as cholesterol),
a significant association between campesterol concentration and myocardial
infarction was observed (Thiery et al., 2007).
In a cohort of 2542 subjects (participants of the Dallas Heart Study), the
relationships between phytosterol plasma concentrations and a) a family history of
CHD and b) coronary artery calcium levels were examined. The latter is a marker

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

147

of coronary atherosclerosis, which can be detected by electron beam computer
tomography. No association was found for either end-point for ȕ-sitosterol and
campesterol levels, but plasma cholesterol levels were significantly associated with
both CHD family history and coronary artery calcium (Wilund et al., 2004).
In a prospective nested case–control study (1993–2003, European Prospective Investigation of Cancer [EPIC] Norfolk population study, including 25 633
men and women between 45 and 79 years of age) of 373 cases of coronary
artery disease and 758 controls, ȕ-sitosterol and campesterol plasma concentrations were investigated. Blood samples were taken at the beginning of the
prospective study. Phytosterol concentrations were similar in both groups and were
not associated with coronary disease. The ȕ-sitosterol/cholesterol ratio was
significantly lower in cases than in controls; the campesterol/cholesterol ratio did
not differ between groups (Pinedo et al., 2007).
A group of 1242 individuals aged >65 years who participated in the crosssectional Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) was investigated for an
association between CHD and phytosterol plasma concentrations. Concentrations
of ȕ-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and brassicasterol, as well as their ratios
to cholesterol, were significantly lower in cases than in controls. Based on logistic
regression analysis, a reduced risk for CHD was associated with higher ȕ-sitosterol
levels (Fassbender et al., 2008).
Similarly, results from another case–control study with women with incident
CHD and age-matched population-based controls did not show an association
between phytosterol plasma concentrations and CHD risk. Phytosterol plasma
levels of 186 female CDH patients were compared with those of 231 healthy
controls. Phytosterol levels of patients were higher than those of controls and did
not show a correlation to CHD risk. After adjustment to cholesterol, the odds ratio
was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.61í1.30) (Windler et al., 2009).
2.5.4 Other effects
In a population-based study, possible health effects after long-term (1-year)
consumption of food enriched with phytosterol esters were investigated in 185
volunteers. No adverse health effects were reported that could be linked to
phytosterol supplementation. Levels in erythrocyte membranes paralleled the
increase in plasma concentrations. No changes in erythrocyte membrane rigidity or
deformability were observed. No consistent effects on clinical chemistry or
haematological parameters were observed. Hormone levels in female and male
participants were unaffected by phytosterol consumption (Hendriks et al., 2003).
Female sex hormone levels were investigated in a human trial including
24 healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females). Study participants daily
consumed 40 g of a margarine enriched with phytosterol esters (8.6 g phytosterols/
day) or a standard margarine. Serum sex hormone levels (estradiol, estrone,
progesterone, human luteinizing hormone, follicular stimulating hormone and sex
hormone binding globulin) in females were unaffected by phytosterol ester
consumption compared with controls, with the exception of progesterone, which
was significantly lower in the test group. Faecal composition and faecal bacterial

148

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

enzyme activity were determined in male and female participants and did not reveal
important biological effects (Ayesh et al., 1999).
3.

DIETARY EXPOSURE

3.1

Introduction

The Committee has not previously evaluated the dietary exposure to
phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters. The Committee received and reviewed
information submitted by two sponsors, as well as published information from
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (European Food Safety Authority,
2008) and the USFDA (accessible online at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~rdb/
opa-gras.html).
The relative molecular masses of the five major phytosterols and
phytostanols—namely, campesterol and campestanol, ȕ-sitosterol and ȕsitostanol, and stigmasterol—range from 400 to 416 and have not been
differentiated in this monograph owing to the small relative differences among them.
Also, the ratio between the relative molecular masses of the collective free
phytosterols and phytostanols and their esters is taken to be 60% as a default
(3.4 g of esterified phytosterols or phytostanols to metabolically deliver 2 g of free
phytosterols or phytostanols).
3.2

Use in foods

The use of phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters in foods is unusual
with respect to common food additives, in that they do not impart a technical effect
in the food, but rather are intended to lower serum LDL cholesterol in consumers.
The phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters are regulated or allowed for use in
numerous countries, particularly in the European Union (EU), the USA, and
Australia and New Zealand, either as food additives/ingredients or as supplements.
The cholesterol-lowering effects of the phytosterols, phytostanols and their
esters are stated to plateau at approximately 2 g/person per day. Consequently,
food manufacturers have been formulating products containing free phytosterols
and/or phytostanols so as to deliver a convenient “dose”, requiring one, two or three
standard portions a day to reach the 2-g level of intake (or, for the esterified
products, 3.4 g). Rather than a single upper use level, such as “up to 50 mg/kg food”,
the products are individually prepared based on the typical or standard portions sold
in a given jurisdiction. Many product types have been developed, including, but not
limited to, margarines, yogurts and yogurt drinks, cheese products, dairy beverages,
snack (power) bars, candy chews and orange juice. Notices sent to the USFDA
concerning phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters suggested potential uses as
follows: baked goods and baking mixes; egg products; fats and oils; frozen dairy
desserts and mixes; gelatins; ground coffee; grain products and pastas; gravies and
sauces; hard candy; milk; milk products; puddings and pie fillings; soft candy; soups
and soup mixes; and snack foods.

International estimates of dietary exposure

In light of a number of published studies on the dietary exposure of
phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters (summarized in European Food Safety
Authority, 2008), information concerning dietary exposure contained in letters
responding to GRAS notifications in the USA (accessible at the USFDA/Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition [CFSAN] web site), and their specific use for
the reduction of cholesterol in targeted subpopulations, the Committee chose not
to prepare international estimates of dietary exposure to the phytosterols,
phytostanols and their esters.
3.4

National estimates of dietary exposure

3.4.1 Background exposure from food
The natural background exposure to phytosterols, phytostanols and their
esters from foods has been studied. They are found in numerous plant products,
including seeds, nuts and vegetable oils. Both free and esterified forms are
found. It has been estimated that the daily supply of phytosterols, phytostanols
and their esters is in the range of 150–400 mg (Scientific Committee on Food,
2002). This range is in keeping with more recent estimates of dietary exposure
to phytosterols and phytostanols in Finland (305 and 237 mg/day for men and
women, respectively), Spain (276 mg/day for the four main phytosterols) and
the United Kingdom (300 and 293 mg/day for men and women, respectively) (Valsta
et al., 2004; Jiménez-Escrig et al., 2006; Klingberg et al., 2007). The phytosterols
are typically approximately 90% of the total phytosterol/phytostanol mix in a food.
A study of 200 consumers of a typical German diet showed excretion rates of
10–25 mg phytostanols/day, taken to be equivalent to background exposure, as the
phytostanols have very limited absorption in the human gut.
3.4.2 “Directed” exposure from food
As discussed above, consumers of foods containing phytosterols,
phytostanols and their esters are directed to consume them in one, two or three
portions a day in order to achieve a physiologically effective dose of 2 g free
phytosterols and/or phytostanols (3.4 g/day of the esterified forms). The Committee
was aware that products containing phytosterols, phytostanols or their esters are
markedly more expensive than the same products without them (up to 5 times the
cost for some products in the United Kingdom market, as reported in European Food
Safety Authority, 2008) and concluded that inadvertent purchase and consumption
of such products over a lifetime were highly unlikely. Additionally, in the EU, labelling
is required on food products containing phytosterols, phytostanols or their esters,
stating that consumption of more than 3 g/day should be avoided. Therefore, the
Committee concluded that dietary exposure to free phytosterols and phytostanols
would be no more than 30 mg/kg bw per day for a 60-kg individual.

150

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

3.4.3 Potential overconsumption of phytosterols/phytostanols
The convenience of numerous products containing phytosterols,
phytostanols or their esters has raised regulatory concerns about possible
overconsumption, defined in the EU as dietary exposure to more than 3 g/day. In
the USA, while no concerns have been raised concerning potential for overconsumption, an estimate of 90th-percentile exposure to the phytosterols,
phytostanols and their esters of 8 g/day (60% of 12.9 g/day reported for the esters
of phytosterols/phytostanols) was published in a letter to a recent GRAS Notice
(GRN 000206), assuming that individuals would consume all possible products
containing them at the suggested upper use level.
To address any concerns, EFSA completed and published an analysis of
the potential for exceeding 3 g/day dietary exposure to phytosterols, phytostanols
and their esters (European Food Safety Authority, 2008). Data from Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom were
examined. Current and potential future exposure scenarios were included.
Additionally, the market share for products containing phytosterols, phytostanols or
their esters was considered.
Based on studies in Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the report
concludes that current exposure to the phytosterols, phytostanols and their
esters in those markets is less than 2.5 g/day at the mean and 6.6 g/day at the
97.5th percentile (both figures from the Irish study). A post-launch monitoring study
across five countries showed mean dietary exposure ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 g/day,
with 95th-percentile dietary exposure ranging from 2.2 to 3.6 g/day. Of consumers of phytosterol/phytostanol-containing products in this study, 79–95% were
over the age of 45. Also in this study, 5% reported consuming phytosterols/
phytostanols above the 3 g/day level. A lower percentage exceeded 3 g/day in
Germany and the United Kingdom, but 23%, mostly long-term consumers of
phytosterols/phytostanols, reported dietary exposures above 3 g/day in Ireland.
These studies found that less than 5% of consumers reported eating three portions
per day of a food containing phytosterols/phytostanols.
The EFSA report concludes:
In general there seems so far to be little over-consumption of food products with
added plant sterols, rather some consumers don’t eat enough of the products to
gain a real benefit. Modeling showed that consumption on more than three
occasions per day or daily consumption of two or more products each at their
respective recommended intake level was necessary to exceed a daily intake of
3 g of plant sterols.

The Committee concurred with this conclusion.

Summary

The Committee concluded that data currently available support the “directed”
estimate of daily exposure to 30 mg/kg bw per day for consumers of free
phytosterols and phytostanols in foods.

COMMENTS

4.1

Toxicological data

The bioavailability of phytosterols and phytostanols is lower than that of
cholesterol. Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract in humans has been
estimated to be about 5% for ȕ-sitosterol, 15% for campesterol and less than 1%
for ȕ-sitostanol, campestanol and other phytostanols. In a recent human study,
where deuterium-labelled substances were emulsified with lecithin and administered with the diet, even lower absorption rates (campesterol, 2%; ȕ-sitosterol,
campestanol and ȕ-sitostanol, <1%) were observed. Studies in both rats and
humans indicate that the bioavailability of phytosterols and phytostanols is
influenced by the form of administration. Different methods used in absorption
studies may partly explain the quantitative differences observed.
Three sets of toxicity data were submitted to the Committee:
1) studies with phytosterol ester mixtures derived from vegetable oil distillates
(mainly soya bean); the main constituents were ȕ-sitosterol (45–51%),
stigmasterol (17–23%) and campesterol (26–29%), esterified with fatty acids
from sunflower oil;
2) studies with a mixture of unesterified phytosterols and phytostanols, derived
from tall oil, which consisted of ȕ-sitosterol (about 40–65%), ȕ-sitostanol
(16–31%), campesterol (6–15%) and campestanol (2–11%);
3) studies with two types of phytostanol ester mixtures: WDPSE (with a stanol
composition of about 94% ȕ-sitostanol and about 6% campestanol) and
VODPSE (with a stanol composition of about 68% ȕ-sitostanol and about 32%
campestanol).
4.1.1 Short-term studies of toxicity with phytosterol ester mixtures
In a 90-day study of toxicity, rats were fed diets containing phytosterol
esters at a concentration of 0, 0.16, 1.6, 3.2 or 8.1% (w/w). These dietary
concentrations were equal to phytosterol at 0, 0.08, 0.78, 1.6 and 3.9 g/kg bw per
day for males and 0, 0.09, 0.87, 1.8 and 4.2 g/kg bw per day for females (mean
intakes over the study period). Treatment-related effects observed were restricted
to slight changes in haematological parameters (slight reduction in numbers of
platelets, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes) and clinical chemistry values
(increases in serum activity of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase).
There were neither macroscopic findings at necropsy nor histological findings
attributable to treatment with phytosterol esters. On the basis of the minimal
changes noted and the absence of any histopathological changes, the NOEL was

152

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

8.1% phytosterol esters in the diet, equal to phytosterols at a dose of 3.9 g/kg bw
per day, the highest dose tested.
In a 90-day study of toxicity, rats were given phytosterols isolated from soya
beans and esterified with fatty acids from olive oil at a dose of 0, 1, 3 or 9 g/kg bw
per day by gavage. Reduced body weight gain was observed in both sexes, and an
increased incidence of cardiomyopathy was observed in males but not in females
at the highest dose. Slight, reversible changes in haematological parameters
occurred at the two highest doses and were not considered to be adverse effects.
The LOAEL was 9 g/kg bw per day on the basis of effects observed at the highest
dose. The NOAEL for phytosterols was 3 g/kg bw per day.
4.1.2 Short-term studies of toxicity with mixtures of phytosterols and phytostanols
Ninety-day studies of toxicity were available for two mixtures of phytosterols
and phytostanols, which differed slightly in composition owing to different production
processes (solvent extraction, vacuum distillation). In the first study, rats were fed
a phytosterol/phytostanol mixture obtained by solvent extraction at a dietary
concentration of 0, 1.25, 2.5 or 5%, equal to mean intakes of 0, 1.0, 2.0 and
4.2 g/kg bw per day for males and 0, 1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 g/kg bw per day for females
over the study period. No clearly treatment-related effects were seen in this study
at any dose, and the NOEL was 4.2 g/kg bw per day for this mixture of phytosterols
and phytostanols.
The second study was carried out with a phytosterol/phytostanol mixture
obtained by vacuum distillation. Rats were fed the mixture at a dietary concentration
of 0, 1.25, 2.5 or 5%, equal to mean intakes of test material of 0, 0.99, 2.0 and
4.1 g/kg bw per day for males and 0, 1.1, 2.2 and 4.6 g/kg bw per day for females
over the study period. No consistent treatment-related effects were observed, apart
from some changes in clinical chemistry parameters in females, but not in males
(increased activity of serum alanine aminotransferase and Ȗ-glutamyl transferase
and increased concentrations of urea). Although these observations may indicate
early effects in the liver, no histopathological changes were observed in the liver.
The NOEL was 4.1 g/kg bw per day.
4.1.3 Short-term studies of toxicity with phytostanol ester mixtures
In a 90-day study of toxicity, rats were given one of two mixtures of
phytostanol esters of similar composition, which were derived from wood and from
vegetable oil, respectively. Rats received feed containing the wood-derived mixture
at a concentration of 0, 0.34, 1.7 or 8.4% (w/w) or the vegetable oil–derived mixture
at a concentration of 0, 0.36, 1.8 or 8.9% (w/w), which correspond to the same levels
of phytostanols in the feed. Mean intakes of phytostanols from both mixtures were
0, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.7 g/kg bw per day for males and 0, 0.1, 0.6 and 3.0 g/kg bw per
day for females over the study period. The most prominent treatment-related
findings for both mixtures were decreases in plasma concentrations of vitamins E,
D and K1 in both sexes at the highest dose (about 8.5% phytostanol esters in the
diet). Plasma concentrations of vitamin A and ȕ-carotene were unaffected at all
dietary concentrations. The influence of phytosterols and phytostanols on

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

153

carotenoid and vitamin concentrations was also investigated in numerous studies
in humans (see below). In several of these studies (with doses of up to 3 g/person
per day), decreases in plasma concentrations of carotenoids (Į-carotene,
ȕ-carotene, lycopene) and of Į-tocopherol could be observed, but concentrations
of vitamins A, D and K were unaffected. This is in contrast to the effects on vitamin
concentrations observed in the study in rats mentioned above, which renders the
significance of these findings for humans unclear. The effects on plasma
concentrations of vitamins were not investigated in the 90-day study of toxicity with
phytosterol esters; thus, it remained unclear whether the effects observed with
phytostanol esters are unique to this mixture. Taking into consideration the fact that
the respective effects on vitamin concentrations were not observed in studies in
humans, the Committee concluded that these effects were not to be considered in
this evaluation.
4.1.4 Studies of reproductive toxicity with phytosterol ester mixtures
In a two-generation study of reproductive toxicity, rats were fed diets
containing phytosterol esters at concentrations of 0, 1.6, 3.2 and 8.1% (w/w), equal
to 0, 0.5–2.3, 0.9–4.5 and 2.3–12.6 g/kg bw per day, respectively (ranges of weekly
averages). The only treatment-related observations were slight, but significant,
decreases in food consumption, food efficiency and body weight gain of F0 and F1
males and females at the highest dose. The viability index of pups at PND 4 for F0
and F1 pups was slightly decreased, but no differences in pup mortality were
observed when analysed on a litter basis, and pup weights of both generations were
unaffected. The NOEL was 8.1% phytosterol esters in the diet, equal to 2.7 g/kg bw
per day expressed as phytosterols (average exposure during premating and
gestation for F0 and F1 females).
4.1.5 Studies of reproductive toxicity with phytostanol ester mixtures
In a two-generation study of reproductive toxicity, rats were given feed
containing a mixture of phytostanol esters at a concentration of 0, 1, 2.5 or 5%
phytostanols. Intakes of phytostanols in F0 and F1 were 0.6–1.3, 0.4–0.7 and
1.0–2.1 g/kg bw per day for the low dose group females during premating, gestation
and lactation, respectively (ranges of weekly averages). For the middle-dose
females, intake levels were 1.5–3.4, 1.0–1.7 and 2.5–5.6 g/kg bw per day during
premating, gestation and lactation, respectively. For high-dose females, intake
levels were 3.2–7.3, 2.1–3.6 and 5.2–11.1 g/kg bw per day during premating,
gestation and lactation, respectively. Intakes by F0 and F1 males during premating
were 0.5–1.4, 1.3–3.5 and 2.8–7.7 g/kg bw per day for low-, middle- and high-dose
animals, respectively. The only treatment-related effect observed was decreased
pup body weights in both generations at the highest dose at PND 14 and PND 21.
Based on these effects observed in the highest dose group (dietary concentration
5%, equal to a LOAEL of 8.1 g phytostanols/kg bw per day, calculated as the
average dose during lactation), the dietary concentration of 2.5% phytostanols was
considered the NOAEL for reproductive and developmental toxicity in this study,
which equals 4.1 g phytostanols/kg bw per day (average dose during lactation).

154

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

In a prenatal developmental toxicity study, a mixture of phytostanol esters
was fed to female rats during gestation days 0–21 at concentrations of 0, 1.8, 4.4
and 8.8% phytostanol esters, which correspond to concentrations in the diet of 0,
1, 2.5 and 5% phytostanols. In the high-dose group, maternal body weights were
transiently reduced. No treatment-related effects with respect to malformations or
developmental toxicity were observed. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in this
study was 3.2 g phytostanols/kg bw per day.
4.1.6 Genotoxicity
All mixtures were inactive in assays for gene mutations in vitro in bacteria
and in mouse lymphoma cells and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro
in mammalian cells. Phytosterol esters and a mixture of phytosterol esters and
phytostanol esters were inactive in assays for micronuclei induction in the bone
marrow of rodents in vivo. Phytosterol esters did not induce unscheduled DNA
synthesis in rat liver.
4.1.7 Estrogenicity
Phytosterols, a mixture of phytosterols and phytostanols, and phytostanols
were investigated for possible estrogenic activity. They did not reveal uterotrophic
activity in vivo in immature female rats. Phytosterols failed to show estrogenic
activity in vitro in the competitive estrogen receptor binding assay and the
recombinant yeast assay. Also, phytostanols did not induce proliferation of human
mammary adenocarcinoma cells.
4.2

Human studies

In several double-blinded, placebo-controlled human studies, where subjects received diets containing added phytosterol esters or phytostanol esters,
reduced plasma concentrations of carotenoids and Į-tocopherol were noted. In
these studies, phytosterol and phytostanol esters were administered over periods
of 3–8 weeks. In most of these studies, no effects on (pro)vitamins were observable
when concentrations were lipid adjusted. In a study of 1-year duration, serum
concentrations of Į-carotene, ȕ-carotene, Į-tocopherol and lycopene were lower
after phytosterol ester consumption (1.7 g phytosterols/day as esters in fat spread)
in 185 healthy subjects, compared with controls. Decreases of lipid-adjusted Įcarotene and ȕ-carotene levels were statistically significantly higher in the exposed
group. Another 1-year study investigated the effects on carotenoid levels after
administration of sitostanol esters in fat spread (3.0 g ȕ-sitostanol/day). Absolute
plasma levels of Į-carotene, ȕ-carotene and Į-tocopherol were significantly
reduced. If normalized to cholesterol concentration, only reduction of the ȕ-carotene
plasma concentration was statistically significant. In some of the human studies, a
possible influence on vitamins A, D and K was also investigated. Plasma
concentrations of these vitamins were generally not affected by consumption of food
enriched with phytosterols, phytostanols or their esters. This indicates that the
marked effects on these vitamins observed in a 90-day study, where rats were fed

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

155

diets with phytostanol esters, were not observed in humans, at least at dose levels
applied in the human studies (1–3 g/day).
Available data show that diets containing added phytosterols, phytostanols
or their esters in doses up to 2 g/day (as phytosterols/phytostanols) lead to (up to)
2-fold increases in plasma concentrations. Various epidemiological studies
investigated a possible correlation between phytosterol plasma levels and
indicators for atherosclerosis and an increased risk for CHD. Taken together, to date
there is no convincing evidence for an association of elevated phytosterol levels and
increased risk for CHD.
4.3

Assessment of dietary exposure

The Committee received and reviewed information on dietary exposure
submitted by two sponsors, as well as published information from EFSA and the
USFDA. The relative molecular masses of the five major phytosterols and
phytostanols—namely, campesterol and campestanol, ȕ-sitosterol and ȕsitostanol, and stigmasterol—range from 400 to 416 and have not been differentiated owing to the small relative differences among them. Also, the ratio between
the relative molecular masses of the collective free phytosterols and phytostanols
and their esters was taken to be 60% as a default (3.4 g of esterified phytosterols
or phytostanols to metabolically deliver 2 g of free phytosterols or phytostanols).
Phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters are regulated or allowed for use
in numerous countries, particularly in the EU, the USA, Australia and New Zealand,
either as food additives/ingredients or as supplements. The cholesterol-lowering
effects of free phytosterols and phytostanols are stated to reach a plateau at
approximately 2 g/person per day. Consequently, food manufacturers have been
formulating products containing free phytosterols and/or phytostanols so as to
deliver a convenient “dose”, requiring one, two or three standard portions a day to
reach the 2-g level of intake (or, for the esterified products, 3.4 g). Rather than a
single upper use level, such as “up to 50 mg/kg food”, the products are individually
prepared based on the typical or standard portions sold in a given jurisdiction. Many
product types have been developed, including, but not limited to, margarines,
yogurts and yogurt drinks, cheese products, dairy beverages, snack (power) bars,
candy chews and orange juice. Other potential uses include baked goods and
baking mixes; egg products; fats and oils; frozen dairy desserts and mixes; gelatins;
ground coffee; grain products and pastas; gravies and sauces; hard candy; milk;
milk products; puddings and pie fillings; soft candy; soups and soup mixes; and
snack foods.
The natural background intake of free phytosterols and phytostanols from
numerous plant products, including seeds, nuts and vegetable oils, has been
estimated to be in the range of 150–400 mg/day, with the phytosterols representing
approximately 90% of the total. As discussed above, consumers of foods containing
phytosterols, phytostanols or their esters are directed to consume them in one, two
or three portions a day in order to achieve a dose of 2 g free phytosterols or
phytostanols per day (30 mg/kg bw per day for a 60-kg individual). The Committee
was aware that products containing phytosterols, phytostanols or their esters are

156

PHYTOSTEROLS, PHYTOSTANOLS AND THEIR ESTERS

markedly more expensive than the same products without them (up to 5 times the
cost for some products in the United Kingdom market) and concluded that
inadvertent purchase and consumption of such products over a lifetime were highly
unlikely. Therefore, the Committee concluded that dietary exposure to free
phytosterols and phytostanols would typically be less than 30 mg/kg bw per day.
5.

EVALUATION

The Committee evaluated the toxicological studies with a range of
phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters, together with several double-blinded,
placebo-controlled human studies, in which these substances were added to the
diet. As phytosterol and phytostanol esters and mixtures of phytosterols and
phytostanols generally show similar effect profiles, the Committee considered
establishing a group acceptable daily intake (ADI).
Using the combined evidence from several short-term (90-day) studies of
toxicity, the Committee identified an overall NOAEL1 of 4200 mg/kg bw per day. The
Committee considered the margin between this overall NOAEL and the lowest
LOAEL from the 90-day toxicity studies of 9000 mg/kg bw per day as adequate for
this overall NOAEL to be used as the basis for establishing an ADI. This conclusion
is supported by the results of the available studies of reproductive toxicity.
The Committee established a group ADI of 0–40 mg/kg bw for the group of
phytosterols, phytostanols and their esters, expressed as the sum of phytosterols
and phytostanols in their free form, based on the overall NOAEL, to which a safety
factor of 100 was applied. This safety factor incorporates a factor of 10 for
interspecies differences and a factor of 10 for intraspecies differences. Based on
the availability of a range of studies in humans, which includes two 1-year studies,
the Committee considered the safety factor of 100 as sufficient to also account for
deficiencies in the database, such as the absence of chronic studies in experimental
animals. As there is no evidence for genotoxicity of phytosterols or phytostanols and
their esters and no indication of potential for carcinogenicity from the available
toxicity studies, the Committee did not see a need for a carcinogenicity study to be
performed.
Based on available data, the Committee concluded that dietary exposure
to phytosterols and phytostanols would typically be within the ADI range of
0–40 mg/kg bw.

1

The Committee was aware of the definition of the overall NOAEL by the Joint FAO/WHO
Meeting on Pesticide Residues (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
2004): “When they [the studies] are comparable, including consideration of study design,
end-points addressed, and strain of animals, the overall NOAEL should be the highest value
identified in the available studies that provides a reasonable margin (2) over the lowest
LOAEL, provided that due consideration is given to the shape of the dose–response curve.”

EXPLANATION

Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS)
(synonyms:
dimethylpolysiloxane,
dimethicone) is widely used in foods as an antifoaming and anticaking agent.
PDMS was placed on the agenda by the Secretariat of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Committee on Food Additives for consideration of the applicability of the current
acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–1.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) to the material
currently in commerce. This ADI was established at the eighteenth meeting
(Annex 1, reference 35). When the Committee reviewed the ADI at its twenty-third
meeting (Annex 1, reference 50), it stated that this ADI applied to PDMS with
200–300 repeat subunits of [(CH3)2SiO] (weight-average molecular weight range,
15 000–22 000) because of concern that the material of lower molecular weight
might be more readily absorbed.

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

At its thirty-seventh meeting in 1990 (Annex 1, reference 94), the Committee
revised the specifications for material with a weight-average molecular weight range
of 6800–30 000 (90–410 subunits) and a viscosity range of 100–1500 cSt (mm2/s).
However, the toxicological properties of this material were not re-evaluated. As a
consequence, material with an average weight at the lower end of this range was
outside the limits covered by the previously established ADI.
The Committee at its present meeting considered new studies on the
absorption of two PDMS products: a material with a viscosity of 10 cSt and a
number-average molecular weight of 1000 and a material with a viscosity of 350 cSt
and a number-average molecular weight of 10 000. New toxicological studies were
also reviewed: short-term studies in rats fed diets containing one of these two
materials at concentrations of 10 000–100 000 mg/kg diet and a long-term study
of toxicity and carcinogenicity with the 10 cSt material administered at doses of
100–1000 mg/kg bw.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Absorption, distribution and excretion
The data on blood absorption of PDMS were reported in rats (Lukasiak &
Falkiewicz, 2000). They examined the blood of five Wistar rats fed for 12 days with
a granulated feed diet without PDMS, five rats fed for 12 days with the diet with
added 5% PDMS and five rats fed for 12 days with the diet with added 5% cycloPDMS oil. Concentrations of PDMS were 26 ± 14 μg/cm3 and 70 ± 97 μg/cm3 in
samples from animals given feed PDMS and cyclo-PDMS, measured with a 1H
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. PDMS was not detected in any
blood sample from animals given feed without PDMS.
The absorption of [14C]PDMS with viscosities of 350 cSt and 10 cSt from the
gastrointestinal tract was evaluated in male and female F344 rats 96 h following a
single oral gavage to 1000 mg/kg bw. Orally administered [14C]PDMS with
viscosities of 350 cSt and 10 cSt was excreted unchanged in the faeces, with little,
if any, absorption. The total dose recovery of [14C]PDMS with a viscosity of 350 cSt
in male and female rats was 97.4% and 93.6%, respectively; for [14C]PDMS with a
viscosity of 10 cSt, the total dose recovery was 91.0% and 93.4% for male and
female rats, respectively (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2000,
2001).
These absorption experiments are compared in Table 1.

Toxicological studies

2.2.1 Acute toxicity
No new data were available.
2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
PDMS fluids with a viscosity of 35 cSt or 1000 cSt were evaluated for
palatability at various concentrations in ground rodent chow. Groups of CD-1 mice
(six per sex per group) were given 1, 5 or 10% PDMS fluid in food (10 000, 50 000
and 100 000 mg/kg diet) for 28 days. No deaths, changes in behaviour or changes
in mean body weights were observed. Statistically significant increases in food consumption were observed in the 5% and 10% PDMS fluid groups. No anal leakage,
oily coats or changes in faecal consistency were observed in mice given a 1% diet
of 35 cSt or 1000 cSt PDMS. There was slight anal leakage in the 5% 35 cSt PDMS
group, but not in the 5% 1000 cSt PDMS group. Anal leakage was slight to severe
in the 10% 35 cSt PDMS group and normal to moderate in the 10% 1000 cSt PDMS
group. There were no changes in faecal consistency in these 5% and 10% PDMS
groups (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1994c).
The potential toxic effects of 10 cSt and 350 cSt PDMS were evaluated in a
28-day study in F344 rats at dietary concentrations of 10 000, 25 000, 50 000 and
100 000 mg/kg. An increased incidence (onset and area) of corneal opacities was
observed in all treated groups. Test article–related corneal lesions (hyperplasia,
haemorrhage, granulomatous inflammation and suppurative inflammation) were
observed microscopically in males and females given PDMS in the diet at 50 000
and 100 000 mg/kg for 10 cSt PDMS and at all concentrations for 350 cSt PDMS.
Other test article–related effects included matting of the fur in males and females
at 50 000 and 100 000 mg/kg diet, increased mean food consumption in males

168

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

and females at 50 000 and 100 000 mg/kg diet and lower mean triglycerides
and low density plus very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL + VLDL Chol)
levels in males at 25 000 and 50 000 mg/kg diet and in males and females at
100 000 mg/kg diet when 10 cSt PDMS was administered. In the case of 350 cSt
PDMS, the only other test article–related effect was yellow matting of the fur,
primarily at a dietary concentration of 100 000 mg/kg. If the ocular lesions are
considered to be the result of a topical effect and not a systemic effect, the lower
triglycerides and lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL + VLDL Chol) levels were not
considered by the study laboratory to be an adverse effect, and the matting of the
fur is due to anal leakage. For 350 cSt PDMS, the no-observed-adverse-effect level
(NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was considered by the study laboratory to be greater
than 100 000 mg/kg diet (equivalent to 5000 mg/kg bw) (United States
Environmental Protection Agency, 1995b, 1995c).
Potential toxic effects of the test article, 10 cSt and 350 cSt PDMS, were
evaluated in a 13-week study in rats at dietary concentrations of 5000, 10 000,
25 000 and 50 000 mg/kg. The test article was administered to four groups, each
consisting of 15 male and 15 female CDF (F-344) CrlBr rats 25 days of age for
350 cSt PDMS and 28 days of age for 10 cSt PDMS. In the case of the 10 cSt PDMS,
all animals survived to the scheduled necropsy. Test article–related clinical signs
consisted of a dose-related increase of matting at the base of the tail and the
anogenital region (wet and dried yellow) in males and females at 50 000 mg/kg
and an increase in severity of corneal opacities in males and females at 25 000
and 50 000 mg/kg. Ophthalmological examination revealed an increase in severity
of corneal crystals in males and females at 25 000 and 50 000 mg/kg diet.
Vascularization of the corneal stroma was also observed in males at dietary concentrations of 25 000 mg/kg and in males and females at 50 000 mg/kg. Suppurative
inflammation and neovascularization of the corneal stroma were observed in the
same groups at the histopathological evaluation. No test article–related effect on
body weight was observed. Treatment-related increases in mean food consumption
were apparent at 10 000 (males only), 25 000 and 50 000 mg/kg diet and were
presumably related to the nutritive balance at the high concentration of the test
article in the diet (5% of test article in the diet at 50 000 mg/kg). Haematological and
urinalysis parameters were unaffected by dietary intake of 10 cSt PDMS. Mean
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and phospholipid
levels were reduced in all treated groups of males and were statistically significant
(P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) except for the cholesterol and phospholipid means in males
at 5000 mg/kg. Aside from corneal changes, no test article–related histomorphological changes were observed. Dietary administration of 10 cSt PDMS at 25 000
and 50 000 mg/kg diet produced an increase in severity of corneal crystals
(observed grossly as opacities) and corneal vascularization. Microscopic
suppurative inflammation and neovascularization of the corneal stroma were also
observed at these dosage levels. Other test article–related effects included base of
tail/anogenital matting in males and females at 50 000 mg/kg, increased mean food
consumption in males at 10 000 mg/kg and in males and females at 25 000
and 50 000 mg/kg diet (presumably due to the high concentration of the non-nutritive
test article in the diet) and reduced mean total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and
phospholipid for all treated groups of males. The NOAEL for 10 cSt PDMS was

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

169

considered to be 50 000 mg/kg diet, equivalent to 2500 mg/kg bw (United States
Environmental Protection Agency, 1995a). When 350 cSt PDMS was administered,
yellow matting at the base of the tail was noted in the 2500 mg/kg group during
weeks 8–13 at the weekly physical examinations. Corneal opacities were first noted
in the diet-treated groups, followed by the gavage-treated groups, then the control
groups. After 3 weeks of dosing, all animals in all groups had corneal opacities. The
severity of the corneal opacities (noted as corneal crystals by the veterinary
ophthalmologist) was increased in a dose-related manner in all treated groups when
compared with the control groups. At the microscopic examination, suppurative
inflammation of the corneal epithelium occurred at a dose-related increased incidence in all treated groups when compared with the control groups. Food consumption was increased in males and females at a dietary concentration of 50 000 mg/
kg (essentially throughout the study). These increases were presumably due to
the high concentration of non-nutritive test article in the diet (5% of the diet at
50 000 mg/kg). Lethalities and slight clinical signs (yellow matting at the base of the
tail) were observed at 2500 mg/kg. In general, dose-related increases in the severity
of corneal crystals (observed grossly as corneal opacities) were observed in all
treated groups (diet and gavage). Microscopically, suppurative inflammation of the
corneal epithelium was noted in all treated groups; the number of animals affected
was dose related. The NOAEL for 350 cSt PDMS was considered by the study
laboratory to be greater than 50 000 mg/kg diet (equivalent to 2500 mg/kg bw)
(United States Environmental Protection Agency, 1995d).
The oral toxicity of 35 cSt PDMS fluid was evaluated in relation to its potential use as a fat substitute in certain foods. Three groups of 15 male and 15 female
CD-1 mice were given 0, 5 or 10% 35 cSt PDMS fluid in the diet (0, 50 000 and
100 000 mg/kg diet) for 90 days. Most animals in the 10% dietary group exhibited
oily fur, and most anal leakage was seen in females in this dietary group. There
were significant increases in food consumption in treated groups compared with
controls, with the greatest consumption seen in the 10% dietary group. No noted
changes in stool consistency or coating were observed in any treated animals. No
deaths or behavioural abnormalities were observed, and there were no significant
differences in body weights or organ weights. No significant treatment-related
effects were observed during necropsy or histopathological examination (United
States Environmental Protection Agency, 1994a).
PDMS fluids at viscosities of 35, 350 and 1000 cSt were evaluated to
determine their subchronic oral toxicity. Five groups of 100 male rats each received
0 (two control groups) or 10% PDMS fluids of each viscosity in their feed (0 and
100 000 mg/kg diet) for 90 days. The animals were observed twice daily for signs
of toxicity, appearance, behaviour and mortality. Body weights were recorded at the
initiation of the study and weekly thereafter, whereas food consumption was
determined weekly. Haematological parameters were measured prior to the
termination of the study. All surviving animals were sacrificed and examined by
gross necropsy and histopathologically. No statistically significant differences
between treated and control rats were reported in any end-point examined with any
of the three viscosities of the test material (United States Environmental Protection
Agency, 1994b).

2.2.3 Long-term studies of toxicity and carcinogenicity
In order to evaluate possible long-term toxic and oncogenic effects, 10 cSt
PDMS fluid was administered orally in the diet to F344 rats for 12 and 24 months.
PDMS fluid with a viscosity of 10 cSt was administered on a continuous basis in the
diet at dose levels of 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw per day. Each group consisted of
90 male and 90 female F344 rats. At the outset, the males were 38 days old and
the females were 37 days old. The animals were observed twice daily for mortality
and morbidity. Clinical observations were recorded daily, and detailed physical
examinations, palpable masses, body weight and food consumption were recorded
weekly. Clinical pathology parameters (haematology, serum chemistry and
urinalysis) were evaluated for 20 animals per sex per group at approximately 3, 6
and 12 months of the study. In addition, blood smears were prepared from all
animals that were euthanized in extremis and from the animals from the oncogenicity study (24 months) at the study week 104 primary necropsy. Ophthalmic
examinations were conducted prior to test article administration (study week –1)
and during study weeks 12, 51 and 103. Necropsies were performed on all animals,
and selected organs were weighed. Selected tissues were examined
microscopically from all animals.
Survival was unaffected by test article administration. Survival in the animals
from the chronic toxicity study (12 months), the animals from the chronic recovery
study (24 months) and the animals from the oncogenicity study (24 months) was
70% or greater in all groups. There were no toxicologically significant test article–
related effects on body weight, food consumption or clinical pathology parameters.
There were no test article–related macroscopic or microscopic (neoplastic or nonneoplastic) findings for the animals from the chronic toxicity study (study week 52
interim necropsy). There were no test article–related proliferative changes observed
in the animals from the chronic recovery study (study week 104). Test article–related
clinical findings consisted of slightly increased incidences of corneal opacities in
males at 300 mg/kg bw per day and in males and females at 1000 mg/kg bw per
day. Possible test article–related macroscopic findings were limited to increased
incidences of corneal opacity for the animals from the oncogenicity and chronic
recovery studies. In the 24-month study with 10 cSt PDMS in F344 rats, corneal
opacity was observed at slightly increased incidences in males at 1000 mg/kg bw
per day and in females at 100 and 1000 mg/kg bw per day. In the animals from the
chronic recovery study, the incidence of eye opacity was slightly increased in all test
article–treated male groups (not dose related). Corneal opacity was usually correlated with the microscopic finding of keratitis or the incidental microscopic finding
of corneal dystrophy. Microscopically, exposure to the test article for 2 years did not
result in any evidence of systemic toxicity. Inflammation of the nasolachrymal duct
was observed with slightly increased incidence and severity in males at 1000 mg/kg
bw per day. An increased incidence of primarily minimal to mild keratitis was
observed in all test article–related males and females in the oncogenicity group.
The test article–treated animals from the oncogenicity study also had a higher
incidence of bilateral keratitis compared with the control group animals, in which
keratitis was usually unilateral. The increased inflammation in the duct at this level
was considered secondary to test article draining from the eye into the duct and

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

causing local irritation. There were no test article–related neoplastic or
preneoplastic changes in the animals in the oncogenicity group. A statistically
significant increase in the incidence of islet cell adenomas of the pancreas was
observed in the 100 mg/kg bw per day group males after 2 years of treatment.
However, the lack of relevant increased preneoplastic changes in the pancreas, lack
of effect in the female groups, high incidences of islet cell adenomas in the control
group animals assigned to the chronic recovery group and reported historical
incidence ranges in control group animals suggested that the increased incidence
of islet cell adenomas in the 1000 mg/kg bw per day group was not test article
related. There were no indications of systemic toxicity when 10 cSt PDMS fluid was
administered to rats for 24 months. There were no effects on survival that could
have had a negative impact on the objectives of the study. Evidence of local irritation
was noted in the eye and the nasolachrymal duct. There were no treatment-related
neoplastic findings at any dose level. Based on the results of this study, the noobserved-effect level (NOEL) for systemic toxicity and oncogenicity of 10 cSt
PDMS fluid administered in the diet for 12 months and 24 months, respectively, to
F344 rats was 1000 mg/kg bw per day for males and females (United States
Environmental Protection Agency, 2003; Meeks et al., 2005).
2.3

Observations in humans

In an evaluation of human exposure, it was concluded that PDMS is not
absorbed to any appreciable extent through the skin or from the gastrointestinal
tract, from which it is rapidly excreted unchanged in the faeces (European Centre
for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals, 1994).

DIETARY EXPOSURE

PDMS is a silicon-based organic polymer that is used as an antifoaming
agent in fruit and vegetable juices, an anticaking agent in confectionery and flour
products, and an emulsifier in edible oils essentially free of water.
PDMS is included in the current version of the Codex General Standard for
Food Additives (GSFA) for use in a wide range of foods at acceptable maximum
levels from 10 to 110 mg/kg food (Table 2).

Screening by the budget method

The budget method can be used to estimate the theoretical maximum
level of PDMS in those foods and beverages that are likely to contain the food
additive that would not result in the ADI being exceeded by the population (Hansen,
1979; World Health Organization, 2001). If it is assumed that the temporary ADI is

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

173

0–0.8 mg/kg bw per day (see section 5), that 50% of PDMS is used in solid food
and 50% in beverages and that only 25% of the total amount of solid food and
beverages in the food supply contain the food additive, the theoretical maximum
level of PDMS would be 64 mg/kg for food and 16 mg/kg for beverages. The
theoretical maximum levels for solid food and beverages were lower than the
relevant GSFA maximum use level of 110 mg/kg for solid food and 20 mg/kg for
beverages. Hence, data on dietary exposures were required based on the current
version of GSFA acceptable maximum use levels for PDMS.
3.2

Dietary exposure based on individual dietary records

Poundage data were not available for PDMS. Potential dietary exposure
estimates from Australia and New Zealand were submitted, based on individual
dietary records for these populations, individual body weights and GSFA maximum
levels of use. PDMS is permitted at Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) levels
in Australia and New Zealand; no other use level data were available (Food
Standards Australia New Zealand, 2008). Potential mean dietary exposures for
the whole population were 11 mg/day for Australia and 10 mg/day for New Zealand.
For those people who reported consuming foods assigned a PDMS concentration
level, potential mean dietary exposures were the same as those for the whole
population, as PDMS can be used in a wide range of foods. For high consumers
(90th percentile), potential dietary exposures to PDMS were 27 mg/day in Australia
and 26 mg/day in New Zealand (Table 3). The major contributors to total potential
dietary exposure, assuming PDMS to be used in all food categories in the GSFA
listed in Table 2, were water-based flavoured drinks (45% Australia, 37% New
Zealand), alcoholic beverages (18% Australia, 21% New Zealand), flour products
(14% Australia, 20% New Zealand), desserts (6% New Zealand) and fruit and
vegetable preparations (6% Australia).
To determine whether these results were typical of other countries with
similar levels of production of processed foods, potential dietary exposures to PDMS
were estimated for several countries using information on diets from the Concise
European Food Consumption Database (European Food Safety Authority, 2008).
Potential mean dietary exposures to PDMS were calculated for the whole adult
population aged 16–64 years for the 17 countries in the database, assuming PDMS
was used at the GSFA maximum levels. Potential mean dietary exposures for
each country ranged from 17 to 30 mg/day; for high consumers of PDMS, potential
dietary exposures ranged from 35 to 83 mg/day (Table 4). High-consumer dietary
exposures were estimated by taking the consumption for the two food categories
with the highest dietary exposure at the 95th percentile plus the mean for the
population for all other food categories (European Food Safety Authority, 2008).
Major contributors were “cereal and cereal-based products”, “non-alcoholic
beverages” and “alcoholic beverages”. However, it should be noted that basing
potential dietary exposures on the amounts of food consumed for 15 broad food
categories will overestimate the dietary exposure to PDMS, as the use of PDMS is
often restricted to specific subgroup categories within the broader food groups. This
is true in particular for the “cereal and cereal-based products”, “fruit and fruit
products” and “vegetables and vegetable products” food categories.

Potential dietary exposure estimates were based on food consumption data from the
Concise European Food Consumption Database (European Food Safety Authority, 2008).
Assumptions for all countries were as follows:

1. Summary statistics for 15–64 year age group only, where data available.
2. GSFA levels of use for all food categories permitted at maximum level applied to broad food
groups: “cereal and cereal products” at 50 mg/kg, “sugar and sugar products including
chocolate” at 10 mg/kg, “fats (vegetable and animal)” at 10 mg/kg, “vegetables, nuts, pulses
including carrot and tomato” at 10 mg/kg, “fruits” at 10 mg/kg, “fruit and vegetable juice” at
20 mg/kg, “soft drinks” at 20 mg/kg, “alcoholic beverages” at 10 mg/kg, “dairy-based
products” at 10 mg/kg, “miscellaneous foods including foods for special dietary uses” at
50 mg/kg.
3. Temporary ADI is 0–0.8 mg/kg bw per day (see section 5).
4. High-consumer estimate is derived from consumption for the two food groups with the
highest dietary exposure at the 95th percentile plus the mean for the population for all other
food groups.

3.3

Evaluation of dietary exposure

For Australia and New Zealand, potential mean dietary exposures to PDMS
for consumers only of foods containing PDMS were 19% and 17% of the temporary

178

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

ADI of 0–0.8 mg/kg bw (see section 5), respectively; for 90th-percentile consumers,
potential dietary exposures were 66% and 43% of the temporary ADI, respectively.
Potential mean dietary exposures to PDMS for European countries were similar to
those for Australia and New Zealand, although somewhat higher (potential mean
dietary exposure, 28–49% of the temporary ADI; high consumers’ dietary exposure,
65–138% of the temporary ADI).
The limited data available indicate that there may be potential to exceed the
temporary ADI for high consumers of PDMS; however, all dietary exposures are
likely to be overestimates, as maximum levels of use for PDMS were assumed and,
for the European countries, it was assumed that PDMS was used in broader food
categories than those listed in the GSFA. In reality, this is unlikely, as alternative
food additives will be used in some foods, and use levels may be lower than the
acceptable maximum level.

COMMENTS

4.1

Toxicological data

Orally administered [14C]PDMS with viscosities of 350 cSt and 10 cSt were
excreted unchanged in the faeces, with little, if any, absorption.
Ocular lesions were consistently observed in the available short-term and
long-term studies of toxicity with PDMS given by oral administration in the diet or
by gavage. Dose-related ocular lesions (corneal opacities/crystals, granulomatous
inflammation and suppurative inflammation of the corneal epithelium) were
observed in 28-day and 13-week studies in F344 rats given 10 cSt and 350 cSt
PDMS.
In the long-term study with 10 cSt PDMS in F344 rats, corneal opacity was
observed at slightly increased incidences in males at 1000 mg/kg bw per day and
in females at 100 or 1000 mg/kg bw per day. Corneal opacity usually correlated
with the microscopic finding of keratitis or the incidental microscopic finding of
corneal dystrophy. Inflammation of the nasolachrymal duct was observed with
slightly increased incidence and severity in males at 1000 mg/kg bw per day. Food
consumption, body weight gain, haematology and serum parameters were
unchanged in all the groups treated with PDMS compared with the control group,
and no other adverse effects were observed in short-term or long-term studies.
4.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

PDMS is used as an antifoaming agent in fruit and vegetable juices, an
anticaking agent in confectionery and flour products, and an emulsifier in edible oils
essentially free of water. It is included in the current version of the GSFA for use in
a wide range of foods at acceptable maximum levels of 10–110 mg/kg food.
Budget method calculations indicate that the use of PDMS in solid food and
beverages at the GSFA acceptable maximum levels may result in the temporary
ADI of 0–0.8 mg/kg bw established at the present meeting (see section 5) being
exceeded, assuming use in 25% of solid food and 25% of beverages. Hence, data

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

179

on dietary exposures were required based on the current version of GSFA
acceptable maximum use levels for PDMS.
Poundage data were not available for PDMS. Potential mean dietary
exposure for the Australian population based on individual dietary records was
11 mg/day (0.2 mg/kg bw per day) for consumers of foods containing PDMS; for
high consumers (at the 90th percentile) of PDMS, dietary exposure was 27 mg/day
(0.5 mg/kg bw per day). Potential mean dietary exposure for the New Zealand adult
population was 10 mg/day (0.1 mg/kg bw per day); for high consumers (at the 90th
percentile) of PDMS, potential dietary exposure was 26 mg/day (0.3 mg/kg bw per
day). Major contributors to total potential dietary exposure were water-based
flavoured drinks, alcoholic beverages, flour products, desserts, and fruit and
vegetable preparations.
To determine whether these results were typical of other countries with
similar levels of production of processed foods, potential dietary exposures to
PDMS were estimated for 17 European countries using information on diets from
the Concise European Food Consumption Database for the adult population aged
16–64 years, assuming PDMS was used at the GSFA acceptable maximum levels.
Potential mean dietary exposures to PDMS for European populations ranged from
17 to 30 mg/day (0.2–0.4 mg/kg bw per day); for high consumers (95th percentile),
potential dietary exposures ranged from 35 to 83 mg/day (0.5–1.1 mg/kg bw per
day). Major contributors were cereal and cereal products and non-alcoholic and
alcoholic beverages. However, it should be noted that basing potential dietary
exposures on the amounts of food consumed for 15 broad food categories will
overestimate the dietary exposure to PDMS, as use is often restricted to specific
subgroup categories within the broader food groups.
For Australia and New Zealand, potential mean dietary exposures to PDMS
for consumers only of foods containing PDMS were 19% and 17% of the temporary
ADI of 0–0.8 mg/kg bw, respectively; for 90th-percentile consumers, potential
dietary exposures were 66% and 43% of the temporary ADI, respectively. Potential
mean dietary exposures to PDMS for European countries were similar to those
for Australia and New Zealand, although somewhat higher for high consumers
(potential mean dietary exposure, 28–49% of the temporary ADI; high consumers’
dietary exposure, 66–138% of the temporary ADI).
The limited data available indicate that there may be potential to exceed the
temporary ADI for high consumers of PDMS; however, all dietary exposures are
likely to be overestimates, as maximum levels of use for PDMS were assumed and,
for the European countries, it was assumed that PDMS was used in broader food
categories than those listed in the GSFA. In reality, this is unlikely, as alternative
food additives will be used in some foods, and use levels may be lower than the
acceptable maximum level.
5.

EVALUATION

Absorption studies on the 10 cSt and 350 cSt material indicated that neither
product was absorbed to any significant extent. Also, the new toxicological studies

180

POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (addendum)

did not reveal any significant differences between the two materials. However, the
reports of the toxicological studies on which the ADI was established at the
eighteenth meeting did not refer to any ocular effects, and it is unclear whether
ophthalmological examinations were conducted. Conversely, in all the more recent
short- and long-term studies of toxicity with PDMS reviewed at the present meeting,
dose-dependent increases in the incidence and severity of ocular lesions were
consistently observed after oral dosing both in the diet and by gavage. It was stated
in the study reports that this seems to be a local irritant effect; however, it is unclear
whether the eye might have been exposed topically to PDMS at a level causing
irritation, particularly after administration by gavage. Furthermore, the Committee
was aware that studies of ocular irritation conducted in relation to cosmetic use
resulted in PDMS being classified as a mild to minimal irritant, but the material tested
may have differed from that used in the studies in which PDMS was administered
orally. The mechanism by which the ocular lesions arose is therefore unclear,
although the lack of absorption of PDMS indicates that it is unlikely to be a direct
systemic effect. Consequently, the relevance of the ocular lesions for food use of
PDMS could not be determined.
The previously established ADI of 0–1.5 mg/kg bw was withdrawn. Using an
additional safety factor of 2, the Committee established a temporary ADI of 0–0.8
mg/kg bw for PDMS, pending the results of studies to elucidate the mechanism and
relevance of the ocular toxicity and provision of data on actual use levels in foods.
The temporary ADI applies to PDMS that meets the revised specifications prepared
at the present meeting. The temporary ADI will be withdrawn if the required data
are not provided before the end of 2010.

EXPLANATION

Steviol glycosides are natural constituents of the plant Stevia rebaudiana
Bertoni, belonging to the Compositae family. Stevioside and rebaudioside A are the
component glycosides of principal interest for their sweetening properties.

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

At its fifty-first meeting, the Committee evaluated toxicological data on
stevioside and the aglycone steviol (Annex 1, reference 137) and specified further
information needed. Based on new data and information, at its sixty-third meeting
(Annex 1, reference 173), the Committee determined that the commercial material
should be known as “steviol glycosides” and established tentative specifications for
material containing not less than 95% of the total of four specified glycosylated derivatives of steviol (i.e. stevioside, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C and dulcoside A).
Additionally, the sum of stevioside and rebaudioside A content was specified at not
less than 70% of the four steviol glycosides.
Also at its sixty-third meeting, the Committee reviewed additional biochemical and toxicological data on the major steviol glycosides and on the aglycone
steviol. The Committee noted that steviol glycosides are poorly absorbed and are
metabolized by the intestinal microflora by successive hydrolytic removal of glucose units to the aglycone, steviol, which is well absorbed. Therefore, the toxicity
of the glycosides was related to the steviol content. A temporary acceptable daily
intake (ADI) of 0–2 mg/kg body weight (bw) for steviol glycosides expressed as
steviol was established on the basis of the no-observed-effect level (NOEL)1 of 2.5%
stevioside in the diet, equal to 970 mg/kg bw per day, or 383 mg/kg bw per day
expressed as steviol, in a 2-year study in rats and with a safety factor of 200. In the
groups at 5%, final survival rates in the males and body weight gain and absolute
kidney weights in both sexes showed significant reductions compared with those
in controls. The overall safety factor of 200 incorporated a factor of 2 related to
the need for further information, to be provided by 2007, on the pharmacological
effects of steviol glycosides in humans. The Committee specified the need for
studies involving repeated exposure of normotensive and hypotensive individuals
and patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) and type 2 (non-insulin-dependent)
diabetes to dietary and therapeutic doses. This was because the evidence available
at the time was inadequate to assess whether the pharmacological effects of steviol
glycosides would also occur at dietary exposure levels, which could lead to adverse
effects in some individuals (e.g. those with hypotension or diabetes).
Also at its sixty-third meeting, the Committee estimated international intakes
of steviol glycosides to be in the range of 1.3 (African diet) to 3.5 mg/kg bw per day
(European diet), expressed as steviol, assuming that all dietary sugars (total sugars
and honey) are replaced by steviol glycosides. The Committee acknowledged that
this was a conservative estimate and that actual intakes were likely to be 20–30%
of this figure.
At its sixty-eighth meeting (Annex 1, reference 184), the Committee considered the information that had become available since the sixty-third meeting. This
comprised two submissions, which included a summary of published toxicological
studies and some unpublished data, additional information identified from the
scientific literature and responses intended to resolve the outstanding issues
1

Before the sixty-eighth meeting, the Committee used the term NOEL to include the current
definitions of both NOEL and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). According to the
decision taken by the Committee at its sixty-eighth meeting (Annex 1, reference 187), this
NOEL would now be termed a NOAEL.

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

relevant to the specifications. The Committee was also informed that results of an
ongoing toxicity testing programme, including clinical studies, would be available by
August 2007. The Committee considered that the newly available data did not raise
additional concerns regarding the safety of steviol glycosides, but that the ongoing
clinical studies, which more closely addressed the requirements specified at the
sixty-third meeting, would be essential for the evaluation. The Committee therefore
extended the temporary ADI of 0–2 mg/kg bw for steviol glycosides, expressed as
steviol, pending submission of the results of the ongoing studies by the end of 2008.
Also at the sixty-eighth meeting, the existing tentative specifications were
revised by requiring an assay of not less than 95% of the total of seven named
steviol glycosides, by deleting the assay requirement for the sum of stevioside and
rebaudioside A content to be not less than 70%, by adding pH as an identification
test, by increasing the limit for loss on drying and by establishing a limit for residual
solvent. The tentative designation was removed.
At its present meeting, the Committee considered a submission that comprised a review of all the available information, including studies completed after
the sixty-eighth meeting and some older studies not highlighted in the previous
reviews by the Committee. The new studies included four toxicological studies with
rebaudioside A in experimental animals and clinical trials on the effects of steviol
glycosides on blood pressure in healthy volunteers with normal or low-normal blood
pressure and on glucose homeostasis in men and women with type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Additionally, a literature search was carried out to identify studies published
since the sixty-eighth meeting.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Absorption, distribution and excretion
Five male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered an intravenous injection of 8 mg isosteviol/kg bw. Blood samples were taken immediately prior to
dosing and for up to 48 h after dosing. Urine samples were collected up to 24 h
following dosing. Plasma and urine samples were analysed for isosteviol using
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma levels
declined relatively quickly for 150 min, and then a much slower rate of clearance
was observed. Low renal excretion was observed, and a terminal half-life of
406 ± 31.7 min was calculated. This high terminal half-life was due to a large volume
of distribution (suggesting extensive distribution outside of the plasma) and a
relatively low rate of clearance (Bazargan et al., 2007).
In a study designed to compare the absorption, plasma profiles, metabolism
and excretion of [14C]rebaudioside A, [14C]stevioside and [14C]steviol, single oral
gavage doses were administered to intact and bile duct–cannulated male and
female Sprague-Dawley rats. Doses of 5 mg [14C]rebaudioside A/kg bw, 4.2 mg
[14C]stevioside/kg bw and 1.6 mg [14C]steviol/kg bw were administered for the
absorption, metabolism and excretion parts of the study; these doses were equal

186

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

when converted to steviol. In order to determine the plasma profile, three rats per
sex per substance were dosed and blood samples taken 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h
after dosing. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of the three test compounds were
recorded at 8, 4 and 0.5 h following dosing with [14C]rebaudioside A, [14C]stevioside
and [14C]steviol, respectively. In the main study, 27 animals per sex per compound
were used, and blood samples were taken 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 28 and 72 h after
dosing. Concentrations of radioactivity were found to decline between 15 min and
1 h following dosing with [14C]rebaudioside A and [14C]stevioside and then increased
from 1 to 2–8 h before declining again. The Cmax and the area under the plasma
concentration–time curve (AUC) of steviol were lower for rebaudioside A than for
stevioside, indicating slightly greater formation of steviol from stevioside than from
rebaudioside A. Following an oral dose of [14C]steviol, the Cmax occurred in the first
15 min after administration and declined rapidly between 15 min and 1 h. A small
increase was observed at 2 h, followed by a further decline.
A single dose of test compound was administered to five intact rats per sex
and five bile duct–cannulated rats per sex. For intact rats, urine and faeces were
collected regularly up to 96 h after dosing. For each cannulated rat, bile, urine and
faeces were collected regularly up to 48 h after dosing. Of the total dose in intact
rats, 97–98% of [14C]rebaudioside A and [14C]stevioside and 90% of [14C]steviol
were recovered in the faeces. For all compounds, the majority of the faecal
radioactivity was excreted in the first 24 h after dosing (64–89%), with a further
10–22% excreted in the faeces between 24 and 48 h. No radioactivity was detected
in the carcasses of the animals given any of the test compounds at 96 h after dosing.
In cannulated rats, 70–80% of the [14C]rebaudioside A and [14C]stevioside dosage
was excreted in the bile within 24 h. The remaining dose was excreted in the faeces
(21–30%) and in the urine and cage washings (1–2%). The biliary excretion of
steviol was more rapid, with 50–70% of the dose eliminated in the first 3 h after
dosing. Only 1–2% of the dose was excreted in the faeces, with urine and cage
washings accounting for another 1% (Roberts & Renwick, 2008).
A randomized double-blind cross-over study was carried out to assess
the comparative pharmacokinetics of steviol and steviol glucuronide following
single oral doses of rebaudioside A (purity 98.7%) and stevioside (purity 96.6%) in
eight healthy adult male volunteers (aged 18–45 years, mean age 28 years; mean
body mass index [BMI] 23.8 kg/m2). Doses were equivalent to a steviol dose of
1.65 mg/kg bw, with the doses of rebaudioside A and stevioside being 5 mg/kg bw
and 4.2 mg/kg bw, respectively. Physical examinations were carried out before
and after dosing, and blood, urine and faeces samples were collected daily for 72 h
after dosing. Steviol glucuronide appeared in the plasma of all subjects after administration of rebaudioside A or stevioside, with median times taken to reach the
maximum concentration (Tmax) of 12 and 8 h, respectively, and was eliminated from
the plasma with a half-life of 14 h for both compounds. The AUC for steviol
glucuronide was similar following administration of rebaudioside A and stevioside.
Steviol glucuronide was excreted primarily in the urine during the 72-h collection
period, accounting for 59% and 62% of the rebaudioside A and stevioside doses,
respectively. No steviol glucuronide was detected in the faeces. Steviol was
detected in the plasma of only one subject following administration of both

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

187

compounds, and steviol was detected primarily in the faeces at low levels. The study
was approved by the local ethics committee and met the requirements of the
Declaration of Helsinki (Wheeler et al., 2008).
2.1.2 Biotransformation
The metabolism of stevioside (purity not stated) was investigated in human
saliva, gastric secretions and faecal bacteria, as well as intestinal brush border
membranes and intestinal microflora from rats, mice and hamsters. Stevioside was
unchanged following incubation with human saliva and gastric secretions or with
intestinal brush border membrane vesicles from rats, mice and hamsters. Microflora
from rats, mice, hamsters and humans was found to metabolize stevioside to steviol.
Steviol-16,17Į-epoxide was found to be produced by human faecal bacteria, but
this was converted back to steviol by further action of faecal bacteria (Hutapea et
al., 1997). A review of microbial hydrolysis of steviol glycosides noted that several
other similar studies have been carried out with no epoxide formation being detected
and concluded that this may be an incorrectly identified metabolite or may be due
to the aerobic nature of the medium allowing oxidation to occur (Renwick & Tarka,
2008).
In the studies described in section 2.1.1 above, in which [14C]rebaudioside A,
[ C]stevioside and [14C]steviol were administered by gavage to intact and bile duct–
cannulated male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, the faecal metabolite profiles
were similar between the three test substances, with the predominant metabolite
being steviol in all cases, with a smaller amount of steviol glucuronide being found,
along with a very small percentage of unidentifiable metabolites. Steviol glucuronide
was the predominant radioactive component in the bile, indicating that
deconjugation occurs in the lower intestine (Roberts & Renwick, 2008).
14

Five male and five female healthy volunteers (aged 21–29 years) were
provided with capsules containing 250 mg stevioside (97% stevioside, 2.8%
steviolbioside, 0.2% rebaudioside A) to be taken 3 times per day for 3 days. Doses,
expressed as steviol, were 299 mg/day or 4.60 mg/kg bw per day for females and
4.04 mg/kg bw per day for males. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were taken at
enrolment and after dosing. Urine samples were analysed for bound steviol and
steviol glucuronide. Blood samples were also taken before and after dosing and
analysed for alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutamic–
pyruvic transaminase (GPT), creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. No
significant differences in electrolytes or markers of tissue damage were observed.
The only metabolite detected in urine was steviol glucuronide. The authors concluded that because of its molecular size, the uptake of stevioside by the intestinal
tract is likely to be very low and that stevioside is not degraded by enzymes in the
gastrointestinal tract. However, bacteria found in the gut microflora are able to
metabolize stevioside into free steviol, which is easily absorbed. The authors
suggested that following degradation by the microflora, part of the steviol is
absorbed by the colon and transported to the liver by portal blood, where it is
conjugated with glucuronide, which is subsequently excreted in the urine. This study
was approved by the local ethics committee (Geuns et al., 2006).

188

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

Five male and five female healthy volunteers (aged 21–29 years) were provided with capsules containing 250 mg stevioside (99% purity) to be taken 3 times
per day for 3 days. Doses, expressed as steviol, were calculated to be 294 mg/day
or 4.52 mg/kg bw per day for females and 3.97 mg/kg bw per day for males. Twentyfour-hour urine samples were taken at enrolment and after dosing. A 24-h faeces
sample was collected on the 4th day of the study. Fasting blood samples were
taken before and after dosing, and fasting blood pressure measurements were
taken before the first capsule and at six different time intervals after the first dose.
Urine was analysed for creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium and urea. Blood was
analysed for plasma glucose, plasma insulin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, GPT,
creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Urine, blood and faeces samples were
analysed for free and bound steviol and stevioside. The clinical analyses of blood,
blood pressure and urine showed no differences between samples taken before or
after dosing. No stevioside or free steviol was detected in either blood or urine
samples at any time. Glucuronide-bound steviol was found in blood plasma, with a
mean peak occurring around 30 min after ingestion of the first dose and in 24-h urine
samples. No stevioside or steviol conjugates were found in the faeces, but low levels
of steviol (13–40 mg per 24-h sample) were detected. This study was approved by
the local ethics committee (Geuns et al., 2007).
In a number of studies looking at the ingestion of a single dose of stevioside
in humans (varying doses and numbers of participants), blood, urine and faeces
samples were collected. In all studies, small amounts of unchanged stevioside or
steviol were excreted in the faeces, but the majority of the stevioside dose was
metabolized to steviol, then conjugated with glucuronide and excreted in the urine
and bile (Kraemer & Maurer, 1994; Simonetti et al., 2004).
2.1.3 Effects on enzymes and other biochemical parameters
The effects of stevioside, steviolbioside and one of their metabolites,
isosteviol (purity of each substance 99%), on L-glutamate dehydrogenase extracted
from rat liver mitochondria and purified beef L-glutamate dehydrogenase were
studied. Both enzymes were incubated with the three substances (concentrations
up to 1.5 mmol/l, dissolved in 50% glycerol suspension or diluted with albumin
containing Tris buffer), and reaction rates were measured spectrophotometrically.
No enzyme inhibition was observed with stevioside at any of the concentrations
tested. Steviolbioside at a concentration of 1.5 mmol/l caused 70% inhibition of the
enzymes, and isosteviol caused 45% inhibition at a concentration of 1.5 mmol/l, but
only when the enzymes were diluted in bovine serum albumin and not in glycerol
(Levy et al., 1994).
In several studies using isolated rat cells, rebaudioside A and stevioside
(purity not specified) were found to stimulate secretion of insulin in pancreatic cells
and to interfere with glucose metabolism in adipocyte cells, leading to insulin resistance in adipocytes, which has not been observed in pancreatic cells (Costa et al.,
2003a, 2003b; Abudula et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2006a). In two studies using isolated aortic muscle from rats, isosteviol (99.8% purity in one study) at 10í8–10í5 mol/l
was found to reduce vasopressin-induced contraction of the muscle cells and to
inhibit angiotensin II–induced cell proliferation and endothelin-1 secretion (Wong et

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

189

al., 2004a, 2006). Stevioside was found to stimulate secretion of insulin in pancreatic
islets isolated from NMRI mice with no evidence of desensitization of the ȕ-cells
observed over time; in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1, stevioside was
found to counteract the desensitization of pancreatic cells induced by the diabetes
drug glyburide (Chen et al., 2006a, 2006b).
In a study in which isosteviol (99.8% purity) was incubated with rat aortic
smooth muscle cells (0.01–10 μmol/l) and a range of cardioactive drugs
(vasopressin, phenylaphrine, apamin, glibenclamide, 4-aminopyridine and
charybdotoxin), the intracellular calcium concentration was lowered by isosteviol,
which was mediated through the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium
channels and voltage-gated channels as well as the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–
sensitive potassium channels. Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium
channels did not mediate the action of steviol (Wong et al., 2004b).
Stevioside has the potential to regulate acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase
(ACC) and subsequently may have a role in protecting the function of pancreatic
ȕ-cells when exposed to high levels of glucose (Chen et al., 2007).
Stevioside was found to inhibit absorption of glucose by up to 40% in rat
duodenum at levels of 0.8 mg/ml (Maier et al., 2003).
Stevioside (98% purity) increased the production of proinflammatory
cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Į) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1ȕ) at a
concentration of 1 mmol/l and induced nitric oxide production at 0.1 and 1.0 mmol/l
in unstimulated THP-1 cells. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells,
stevioside (1 mmol/l) reduced the release of TNF-Į and IL-1ȕ and had no effect on
nitric oxide production. The authors concluded that stevioside could have an antiinflammatory role and that its TNF-Į and nitric oxide stimulatory properties may form
a basis to reports of anti-tumour-promoting effects (Boonkaewwan et al., 2006).
A number of other studies were available on steviol-related material of
unspecified composition, for which the administered dose of steviol could not be
identified (Pezzuto, 1986; Chatsudthipong & Thongouppakarn, 1995;
Chatsudthipong & Jutabha, 2001; Chatsudthipong et al., 2003; Nakamura et al.,
2003; Srimaroeng et al., 2005a, 2005b; Chen et al., 2006c; Hong et al., 2006;
Ghanta et al., 2007).

2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
Four groups of 10 female and 10 male HsdRcc Han Wistar rats received a
diet containing 0, 25 000, 50 000, 75 000 or 100 000 mg rebaudioside A
(97% purity)/kg for 4 weeks, with mean doses equal to 0, 3016, 6225, 9353 and
13 016 mg/kg bw per day in males and 0, 3224, 6591, 10 041 and 13 810 mg/kg
bw per day in females, or 0, 993, 2050, 3080 and 4286 mg steviol/kg bw per day in
males and 0, 1062, 2170, 3306 and 4548 mg steviol/kg bw per day in females. This
study was carried out in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.
Free access to control or test diets and drinking-water was permitted throughout the
study except prior to blood and urine tests. Animals were observed for evidence of
ill health twice daily and were weighed 3 days before treatment commenced, on the
day on which treatment commenced and twice weekly throughout the treatment
period until necropsy. Food consumption was measured daily for 3 days prior to
treatment, daily for the first 2 weeks of treatment and twice weekly until the end of
the study. Blood and urine samples were taken in week 4 of the study after overnight
withdrawal of food and water. Blood and urine samples were analysed for a
complete range of clinical chemistry parameters, and blood was analysed for a
complete range of haematological parameters. Animals were sacrificed at the end
of the treatment period, and a wide range of organs were weighed. The testes and
epididymides from all male animals were examined histologically.

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

191

No deaths or physical signs of toxicity were observed in any of the groups.
Slight differences in mean body weight gains and food consumption on day 1 but
not thereafter were observed between animals in the 50 000 mg/kg diet groups and
above and control groups. Females receiving diets containing 50 000 mg
rebaudioside A/kg showed a statistically significant decrease in mean total white
blood cell and lymphocyte count, although individual values were within the historical control range. There was a statistically significant increase in mean creatinine
values in males and females given diets containing 75 000 mg/kg or above and in
males receiving 25 000 or 50 000 mg/kg. Sodium and chloride levels in females
receiving the 100 000 mg/kg test diet were statistically significantly higher than
those in controls. Sodium levels were outside the range of historical controls, but
chloride levels were not. Mean levels of bile acids were significantly lower than in
controls in males and females receiving 75 000 mg/kg or above and in females
receiving 25 000 or 50 000 mg/kg, although these were attributed to one male and
two female animals in the control group with abnormally high values. A significant
increase in specific gravity of the urine was observed in males receiving 75 000 or
100 000 mg/kg, and urinary protein was significantly higher than in controls in males
receiving 50 000 mg/kg or above, although this was still within historical control
values. Adjusted mean weights of the hearts of males receiving 75 000 mg/kg or
above and the adrenals of females receiving 50 000 mg/kg or above were
marginally, but statistically significantly, lower than in controls. Absolute testis
weights were marginally, but statistically significantly, lower in males receiving
100 000 mg/kg when compared with controls. No other treatment-related effects
were observed (Stamp, 2006a; Curry & Roberts, 2008). The NOEL in this study was
100 000 mg rebaudioside A/kg in the feed or 4286 mg/kg bw per day expressed
as steviol.
Three groups of 20 female and 20 male HsdRcc Han Wistar rats received
a diet containing 0, 12 500, 25 000 or 50 000 mg rebaudioside A (97% purity)/kg
for 13 weeks (mean doses equal to 0, 970, 2003 and 4161 mg/kg bw per day in
males and 0, 1141, 2328 and 4645 mg/kg bw per day in females, or 0, 319, 660 and
1370 mg steviol/kg bw per day in males and 0, 376, 767 and 1530 mg steviol/kg bw
per day in females). This study was carried out in compliance with GLP and OECD
guidelines. Free access to control or test diets and drinking-water was permitted
throughout the study except overnight prior to blood and urine tests. Before and
during the treatment period, sensory reactivity and motor activity were tested and
an ophthalmic examination was carried out. Blood and urine samples were taken
on days 10, 46 and 89 of the study. Blood and urine samples were analysed for a
complete range of clinical chemistry parameters, and blood was analysed for a
complete range of haematological parameters. Bone marrow samples were
obtained at necropsy. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the treatment period,
and several organs were weighed. Examination with a light microscope or histological testing was carried out on a range of organs in the control and highest dose
groups. Two animals were killed for welfare reasons during the treatment period as
a result of damage incurred during the blood collection process.
Forelimb grip strength was low for males in the high-dose group in weeks 4,
8 and 12, and hindlimb grip strength in males for all treatment groups was low in

192

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

weeks 8 and 12, although no dose–response relationship or histopathological
changes in muscle or nervous system were found. This was attributed by the
authors to the slightly smaller size of the animals in the group and was not
considered to be treatment related. In the high-dose group, females showed
statistically significantly reduced cage floor activity scores in week 8 only. Rearing
activity was lower in females in week 8 of treatment, but no differences between
test and control groups were seen in week 12. There was a dose-related decrease
in body weight gains, which was significantly different from control at all doses in
the males and at 25 000 and 50 000 mg/kg in the females. Terminal body weights
did not differ significantly from controls in either sex. After day 4, no differences
were seen in food consumption between test and control animals in all groups.
Haemoglobin concentrations and reticulocyte counts were found to be statistically
significantly lower in the 50 000 mg/kg diet group compared with controls on days
46 and 89. No dose–response was observed. Compared with controls, females
receiving 25 000 mg/kg or above showed significantly elevated prothrombin times.
This was not considered to be treatment related. Plasma urea concentrations
were significantly elevated in both sexes in the high-dose group compared with
controls. Non-significant elevations were seen in the two lowest dose groups, and
there was no apparent dose–response relationship. Absolute epididymal weights
for males, ovary weights for females and heart and kidney weights for both sexes
in the high-dose group were statistically significantly reduced compared with
controls. Macropathology and histopathology revealed no apparent treatmentrelated effects. The authors considered that the decreased body weight gain was
due to taste aversion and decreased caloric density of the diet (Stamp, 2006b; Curry
& Roberts, 2008). The NOEL in this study was 50 000 mg rebaudioside A/kg in the
feed or 1370 mg/kg bw per day in males and 1530 mg/kg bw per day in females
when expressed as steviol.
In another study conducted to OECD guidelines in accordance with GLP,
rebaudioside A (purity 99.5%) was fed in the diet to groups of 20 male and 20 female
Sprague-Dawley rats to produce target doses of 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw per
day for 13 weeks. Dietary concentrations covered the ranges of 5000–10 000,
10 000–19 000 and 19 000–36 000 mg/kg, respectively, and were adjusted weekly
to achieve the target dose. Body weights and food consumption were recorded
weekly, a functional observational battery and locomotor activity data were recorded during week 12 and blood samples were collected for haematology and
serum chemistry during weeks 2 and 5. At termination, samples were taken for
haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis. Complete necropsies were performed, selected organs were weighed and selected tissues were examined
microscopically from all animals in the control and high-dose groups. Decreased
body weight gain was noted in males at the top dose of 2000 mg/kg bw per day,
which the authors concluded was due to the lower caloric value of the diet. There
were no other treatment-related observations. The NOEL was 2000 mg/kg bw per
day (Nikiforov & Eapen, 2008).
A number of other studies were available on steviol-related material of
unspecified composition, for which the administered dose of steviol could not be
identified (Lee et al., 1979; Toskulkao et al., 1994a; Wood et al., 1996).

2.2.3 Long-term studies of toxicity and carcinogenicity
The aim of a study with stevia material of unspecified purity was to investigate
potential inhibitory effects on tumour promotion in mice (Yasukawa et al., 2002).
This was not informative for the current evaluation.
In a study to investigate chemoprevention, the effect of rebaudioside A
(purity >99.5%) on azoxymethane (AOM)–induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) was
studied in groups of male F344 rats. One group of 16 rats was given three weekly
subcutaneous injections of AOM for 2 weeks and a diet containing 200 mg
rebaudioside A/kg for 5 weeks, from 1 week before to 2 weeks after AOM administration, and was then sacrificed. The dose expressed as steviol was 6.6 μg/kg bw
per day. Other groups received a diet containing rebaudioside A with no AOM
injections (6 rats), a basal diet with no AOM (6 rats) or AOM injections and a basal
diet only (16 rats). At the end of the study, the colons were removed from eight
animals in the test group and from one in each of the control groups and examined
for ACF. The colonic mucosa of the remaining animals from each group were pooled
and examined for ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Silver-stained nucleolar
organizer region (AgNOR) protein count was also determined for each group. Both
ODC and AgNOR number are biomarkers for cell proliferation. The average body
weights and mean liver weights of the animals receiving the test compound and the
AOM injections were significantly lower than those of the animals receiving AOM
alone. No signs of toxicity were observed, and food consumption was unaffected
by treatment. There was a non-significant trend for rebaudioside A to reduce the
number of AOM-induced ACF, mucosal ODC activity and the number of AgNORs
(Kawamori et al., 1995).
One other study was available on steviol-related material of unspecified
composition, for which the administered dose of steviol could not be identified
(Yamada et al., 1985).
2.2.4 Genotoxicity
A number of genotoxicity studies not previously reviewed were available,
including four reverse mutation assays, all giving negative results up to concentrations of 10–50 mg/plate. One sister chromatid exchange assay, one chromosome
aberration assay and one rec assay were also available, all giving negative results.
Two micronucleus assays using human cells (lymphocytes and buccal mucosal
cells) gave positive results (Hohn & Zankl, 1990). A forward mutation assay with
Salmonella typhimurium strain TM677 gave positive results. In a review by Brusick
(2008), the author concluded that the strain TM677 is uniquely sensitive to steviol
when it is incubated in the presence of S9 from rats induced by polychlorinated
biphenyls only, and therefore this is not likely to be relevant for the situation in vivo.
A comet assay by Nunes et al. (2007) reviewed by the Committee at its sixtyeighth meeting, using rat liver, brain, blood and spleen cells, gave positive results.
The validity of this assay has been questioned by other authors (Geuns, 2007;
Williams, 2007), and the Committee previously concluded that it did not provide
convincing evidence of genotoxicity.
The results of the genotoxicity assays for stevioside and rebaudioside A are
summarized in Table 2.

et al., 1999).
2.2.5 Reproductive toxicity
(a)

Multigeneration reproductive toxicity

Stevioside (purity 93–95%) was used to study the effects on reproduction
in groups of 10 female and 5 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The stevioside material
was administered in the diet at a concentration of 0.15%, providing doses equal to
33 mg/kg bw per day for males and 40 mg/kg bw per day for females expressed
as steviol. After 21 days, the animals were allowed to mate. Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal plug. During pregnancy, all the animals were fed control diet.
Throughout treatment and pregnancy, animals were observed and weighed regularly, and their food consumption was measured. Twenty days after the confirmation
of pregnancy, a laparotomy was performed in half of the animals, and the remainder
were allowed to give birth naturally. Animals given a laparotomy were examined for
fetal absorption, death, dimensions and weight. For animals allowed to give birth
naturally, the number of pups and their weight and condition were recorded. The
adults and offspring of all groups showed no adverse effects, no variations in weight
or food consumption, and no difference in pregnancy ratio between the test and
control groups (Akashi & Yokoyama, 1975).
In a preliminary dose-finding study, three groups of six lactating female
HsdRcc Han Wistar rats housed with their litters received a diet containing 0,
25 000, 37 500 or 50 000 mg rebaudioside A (97% purity)/kg from day 14 to day 21
of lactation (with mean doses on days 14–17 of lactation equal to 0, 4711, 8021 and
9484 mg/kg bw per day and on days 18–20 of lactation equal to 0, 6291, 10 045
and 11 386 mg/kg bw per day). The mean doses expressed as steviol in each of
the groups for days 14–17 of lactation were 0, 1551, 2641 and 3123 mg/kg bw per
day and on days 18–20 of lactation were 0, 2072, 3308 and 3749 mg/kg bw per day.
This study was carried out in compliance with GLP and OECD guidelines. Animals
were observed for evidence of ill health twice daily, with a more detailed examination
being carried out weekly on all F0 and selected F1 juvenile rats. Dams were weighed

196

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

on days 11, 14, 18 and 21 of lactation, all of the F1 juveniles were weighed on days
11, 14, 17 and 21 of age, and selected juveniles were weighed on days 24, 27, 31
and 35 of age. For the dams, food consumption was measured on days 11–13
(pretreatment), 14–17 and 18–20 of lactation. For the selected F1 juveniles, food
consumption was recorded on days 21, 24, 27, 31 and 35 of age. Clinical signs,
litter size, litter body weights, individual juvenile body weights and sex ratio were
recorded for each litter. The dams were killed on day 21 of lactation, the litters were
culled to four females and four males per litter on day 11 of age, unselected offspring
were killed on day 21 of age, and selected offspring were killed on day 35 of age
(10 per sex per group were selected showing good health and having body weights
within the median range). All F0 and all selected F1 juvenile animals underwent a
detailed necropsy with full macroscopic examination of internal and external tissues
in situ. Any abnormalities were recorded, and these tissues were retained. No
deaths or clinical signs of toxicity were observed in any of the groups. Body weight
changes and food consumption were unaffected by treatment. Enlarged parotid
salivary glands were found in a small number of animals in each of the treatment
groups, but the occurrence was not dose related, and the relationship between this
finding and treatment was considered to be uncertain. Based on reduced body
weight gains noted in offspring up to 35 days of age at 50 000 and 37 500 mg/kg
feed, the 25 000 mg/kg dietary concentration was considered suitable for use as
the high dose in the two-generation reproductive toxicity study (Stamp, 2007a; Curry
et al., 2008).
In the main study, three groups of 30 female and 30 male HsdRcc Han
Wistar rats (F0 generation) received a diet containing 0, 7500, 12 500 or 25 000 mg
rebaudioside A (98.5–98.7% purity)/kg for 10 weeks prior to mating and throughout
mating, gestation and lactation until termination. The mean doses in the premating stage of treatment were equal to 0, 586, 975 and 2048 mg/kg bw per day in
males and 0, 669, 1115 and 2273 mg/kg bw per day in females. The mean doses
expressed as steviol in each of the groups were 0, 193, 321 and 674 mg/kg bw
per day in the males and 0, 220, 367 and 748 mg/kg bw per day in the females.
During the gestation period, F0 females received mean doses of 0, 614, 1034 and
2017 mg/kg bw per day (steviol content equivalent to 0, 202, 340 and 664 mg/kg
bw per day); during the lactation period, the F0 females received mean doses of 0,
1052, 1817 and 3832 mg/kg bw per day (steviol content equivalent to 0, 346, 598
and 1262 mg/kg bw per day). The F1 generation comprised 25 males and 25 females
from each group receiving treated diets on weaning and throughout mating, gestation and lactation until termination at the same point as the F0 generation. The mean
doses received at the premating stage were equal to 0, 734, 1254 and 2567 mg/kg
bw per day for males (steviol content equivalent to 0, 242, 413 and 845 mg/kg bw
per day) and 0, 798, 1364 and 2768 mg/kg bw per day for females (steviol content
equivalent to 0, 263, 449 and 911 mg/kg bw per day). For F1 females, the mean
doses were 0, 600, 1004 and 2145 mg/kg bw per day during gestation (steviol
content equivalent to 0, 198, 331 and 706 mg/kg bw per day) and 0, 1170, 2023
and 4066 mg/kg bw per day during lactation (steviol content equivalent to 0, 385,
666 and 1339 mg/kg bw per day). The F2 generation was weaned on a treated diet,
which continued until termination at 30 days of age. At 25 days of age, the offspring
were weaned and separated from the dam; in the case of the F1 generation, 25

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

197

animals were selected from each group. In the F1 and F2 generations, pre-weaning
righting, auditory and visual reflexes were measured. After termination of the
animals, all F0 and F1 adult animals were subject to a detailed examination of the
tissues. Any abnormal organs were recorded and tissues preserved for histological
examination, and many organs were weighed. Abnormal offspring were thoroughly
examined in a similar way to the adults. Food conversion efficiency, estrous cycle,
mating performance, fertility, gestation length, gestation index, pregnancy outcome,
general condition of offspring, litter size, survival, sex ratio, surface- and air-righting
reflexes, auditory startle responses, pupil reflex and reproductive capability were all
considered to be unaffected by treatment in the F0 and F1 generations. No treatmentrelated deaths occurred, and macropathology and histopathology showed no
treatment-related effects in the F0, F1 or F2 generation. Slight differences in food
consumption and body weight gain were noted in the F0 and F1 generations, but
these were not consistent and therefore not considered to be treatment dependent.
The authors concluded that none of the effects observed were treatment related,
as they did not show a dose–response relationship. The authors identified a NOAEL
for reproductive performance and survival, growth and general condition of the
offspring of 25 000 mg/kg in the diet (Stamp, 2007b; Curry et al., 2008). Expressed
as steviol, this was equal to 674 mg/kg bw per day in males and 748 mg/kg bw per
day in females.
(b)

Developmental toxicity

A number of studies were available on steviol-related material of unspecified
composition, for which the administered dose of steviol could not be identified
(Nunes & Pereira, 1988; Sincholle & Marcorelles, 1989; Aritajat et al., 2000;
Saenphet et al., 2006).
2.2.6 Special studies on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
Groups of male Wistar rats (numbers not specified) received treatment to
simulate diabetes. One group received an intravenous injection of streptozotocin,
and one group received fructose-rich chow containing 60% fructose for 4 weeks. A
further control group received standard laboratory chow. Measurements of plasma
glucose and insulin were carried out in fructose-induced diabetic animals, with one
group receiving stevioside (purity 98.6%) in three daily doses of 0.5, 1 or 5 mg/kg
bw each by gavage and one group receiving just the vehicle with no stevioside
added. The doses expressed as steviol were 0.59, 1.17 and 5.85 mg/kg bw per day.
A non-diabetic group also received the vehicle with no stevioside. It is not clear
whether a non-diabetic group received stevioside. Plasma glucose levels were
measured at regular intervals following dosing and were found to be significantly
reduced by stevioside dosing, whether glucose was absorbed from the diet or
injected intraperitoneally. This occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Animals fed
60% fructose concomitantly with 0.5, 1 or 5 mg stevioside/kg bw per day were
studied for effects on insulin resistance. Body weights, plasma glucose and plasma
insulin levels of animals fed high-fructose chow were significantly higher than those
of animals consuming standard chow, but those of animals consuming high-fructose
chow and 5 mg stevioside/kg bw were significantly reduced compared with those

198

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

of animals that consumed a high-fructose diet but no stevioside. Streptozotocininduced diabetic rats were used to investigate the response to exogenous insulin.
These rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of long-acting human insulin (1
International Unit [IU]/kg bw) once a day for 3 days to normalize insulin sensitivity.
Rats were then divided into two groups, with one group receiving three daily doses
of 5 mg stevioside/kg bw by gavage for 10 days and the other group receiving the
same volume and number of doses of vehicle. After dosing, rats received an
intravenous insulin injection of short-acting human insulin, and blood samples were
taken at regular intervals to determine the change in plasma glucose. A positive
control used doses of metformin. Short-acting human insulin together with a dose
of 5 mg stevioside/kg bw caused 40.3% difference in plasma glucose–lowering
activity at an insulin dose of 1 IU/kg bw and 52.4% at a 2.5 IU/kg bw dose of insulin.
The authors concluded that stevioside has a significant effect on insulin resistance
and plasma glucose levels (Chang et al., 2005).
Diabetic male Zucker rats were randomized into four groups, 12 animals per
group, and fed the following test diets for 10 weeks: (A) standard carbohydrate-rich
laboratory chow, (B) chow plus stevioside (30 mg/kg bw per day, 91% stevioside,
4% rebaudioside A and 5% other glycosides; 11.2 mg/kg bw per day expressed as
steviol), (C) 50% soya + 50% chow (adjusted for vitamins and minerals) and (D)
50% soya + 50% chow + 30 mg stevioside/kg bw per day. Plasma glucose, blood
pressure, weight and food intake were measured weekly. At week 10, an intraarterial glucose tolerance test was performed (2 g glucose/kg bw), with blood
samples taken 15 min and immediately before and 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90,
120, 180 and 240 min after glucose infusion. Blood glucose, insulin and glucagon,
triglycerides, free fatty acids and total cholesterol were also measured. In group B,
blood glucose showed a 19% reduction compared with group A; in group D, a 12%
reduction was observed compared with group C. No effects were observed on
insulin or glucagon responses. After 2 weeks, a reduction in systolic blood pressure
was observed in the two stevioside-treated groups. No adverse effects were noted
(Dyrskog et al., 2005a).
Stevioside (99% purity) was administered to diabetic Wistar rats (numbers
not specified) at doses of 0, 0.5, 1 and 5 mg/kg bw per day by gavage for 2 weeks
along with a high-fructose diet. Blood insulin and glucose levels were measured
following the treatment. The animals in the test groups receiving stevioside were
found to have lower blood glucose and insulin levels compared with their diabetic
and control counterparts in the control groups. This effect was statistically significant
and dose dependent (Chen et al., 2005).
Rebaudioside A (97.8% purity) administered in the diet at a dose of 25 mg/kg
bw per day to male GK rats for 8 weeks did not cause any significant changes in
glucose tolerance or glycaemic control when compared with control animals
(Dyrskog et al., 2005b).
Isosteviol (purity 99.4%) was administered to Zucker diabetic rats at single
doses of 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg bw and to normal Wistar rats at single doses of 0 and
10 mg/kg bw. Blood samples were taken at a number of time points after
administration, and plasma insulin and glucose levels were measured. In diabetic

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

199

rats, isosteviol induced a statistically significant reduction in the AUC for glucose
but did not increase plasma insulin. In non-diabetic rats, no effects on plasma
glucose or insulin were observed (Ma et al., 2007).
Using isolated mouse pancreatic islets and INS-1E cell lines, steviosideinduced insulin secretion was studied. Two substances known to decrease ACC
activity were incubated with the islet and INS-1E cells with and without stevioside,
and stevioside-induced insulin secretion was found to be attenuated by the two ACC
blocking substances. Stevioside therefore induces insulin secretion through the
activation of ACC (Xiao et al., 2005).
A number of other studies were available on steviol-related material of
unspecified composition, for which the equivalent dose of steviol could not be
identified (Suzuki et al., 1977; von Schmeling et al., 1977; Toskulkao &
Sutheerawattananon, 1994; Jeppesen et al., 1996; Malaisse et al., 1998; Raskovic
et al., 2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2006; Gorbenko et al., 2005; Ferreira et al., 2006).
2.2.7 Special studies on blood pressure, cardiac function and renal function
Stevioside (95% purity) at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg bw was
administered intravenously to spontaneously hypertensive rats fitted with carotid
artery and jugular vein catheters used to measure blood pressure. A dosedependent, statistically significant hypotensive response was observed for up to
60 min following administration of the stevioside at all three doses (Chan et al.,
1998).
Rebaudioside A (97.8% purity) administered in the diet providing a dose of
25 mg/kg bw per day to male GK rats for 8 weeks did not cause any significant
changes in blood pressure when compared with control animals (Dyrskog et al.,
2005b). This was in contrast to their findings for stevioside in a similar study where
a reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the two treated groups after
2 weeks (Dyrskog et al., 2005a).
Stevioside (100% purity) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to
groups of male and female Wistar rats (numbers not specified) at a dose of 20 mg/kg
bw daily for 4 days. Various cardioactive drugs were administered—adrenaline
(doses up to 0.094 mg/kg bw), verapamil (doses up to 7.62 mg/kg bw) or metoprolol
(doses up to 2.4 mg/kg bw)—and the action of the cardioactive drug was observed.
No changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern were observed following stevioside
administration alone. The heart rate frequency was initially decreased significantly
earlier following stevioside and adrenaline treatment compared with adrenaline
treatment alone, but this effect was reduced and then ceased following continued
infusion of adrenaline. Animals exposed to verapamil following pretreatment with
stevioside showed earlier responses to the drug than those treated with verapamil
alone. Animals exposed to stevioside prior to treatment with metoprolol showed a
reduced sensitivity to the drug compared with those animals given just metoprolol
alone. The authors concluded that stevioside interacts with cardioactive drugs
(Vasovic et al., 2006). The results of this intraperitoneal study could not be
extrapolated to oral administration, because steviol glycosides are poorly absorbed
by the oral route.

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

The effects of isosteviol (99% purity) on Sprague-Dawley rats with heart
ischaemia–reperfusion injury were observed. Animals were divided into eight
groups with 10–12 animals per group: one sham-operated control and seven groups
with ischaemia–reperfusion injury—one ischaemia–reperfusion control group, three
groups pretreated with isosteviol (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg bw), one group pretreated
with ligustrazine and another with 5-hydroxydecanoate, and one group pretreated
with 5-hydroxydecanoate and isosteviol. The ischaemia–reperfusion injury was
produced by occluding the left coronary artery for 30 min followed by reopening
of the artery for 90 min. All compounds were administered intravenously.
Haemodynamic parameters, heart rate, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular
fibrillation were determined during the ischaemia–reperfusion period, and the
myocardial infarct size and serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase
activities were determined at the end of the study. In the groups receiving isosteviol,
the indicators of heart injury were statistically significantly improved compared with
those in groups not receiving isosteviol. The mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium
channel blocker, 5-hydroxydecanoate, partially attenuated the reduction in heart
damage seen in the isosteviol groups (Xu et al., 2007).
A number of studies were available on steviol-related material of unspecified
composition, for which the equivalent dose of steviol could not be identified (Sainati
et al., 1986; De-Yi et al., 1990; Toskulkao et al., 1994a, 1994b; Chang et al., 2006;
Sehar et al., 2008).
2.3

Observations in humans

At its sixty-eighth meeting, the Committee was presented with a number of
studies of observations in humans.
Four male and five female healthy volunteers (aged 21–29 years) were
provided with capsules containing 250 mg stevioside (97% purity) to be taken
3 times per day for 3 days. Doses, expressed as steviol, were 288 mg/day or
4.4 mg/kg bw per day for females and 3.9 mg/kg bw per day for males. Twenty-fourhour urine samples were taken before dosing on day 1 and after dosing on day 3.
Fasting blood samples were taken before dosing on day 1, and six samples were
taken at different time points on day 3 after dosing. Fasting blood pressure
measurements were taken before the first capsule and at six different time intervals
after the first dose. Urine was analysed for creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium
and urea. Blood was analysed for plasma glucose, plasma insulin, alkaline
phosphatase, ALT, GPT, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The clinical
analyses of blood, blood pressure and urine showed no differences between
samples taken before or after dosing. This study was approved by the local ethics
committee (Temme et al., 2004).
In a study unpublished at the time of the sixty-eighth meeting, 250 mg of a
product containing 91.7% total steviol glycosides, including 64.5% stevioside and
18.9% rebaudioside A, was administered to groups of type 1 (n = 8) and type
2 diabetics (n = 15) and non-diabetics (n = 15) 3 times daily for 3 months in a doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial. Control groups with the same number of subjects
received a placebo. After 3 months, there were no significant changes in systolic or
diastolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids, or renal or
hepatic function. No side-effects were reported. This study was approved by the

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

201

local ethics committee and met the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki
(Barriocanal et al., 2006, 2008). The Committee previously noted that this product
did not meet the proposed specification of “not less than 95% steviol glycosides”
and that the study was conducted in a small number of subjects.
A study of antihypertensive effects was conducted in previously untreated
mild hypertensive patients with crude stevioside obtained from the leaves of
S. rebaudiana. Patients with essential hypertension were subjected to a placebo
phase for 4 weeks and then received either capsules containing placebo for 24
weeks or crude stevioside at consecutive doses of 3.75 mg/kg bw per day (7 weeks),
7.5 mg/kg bw per day (11 weeks) and 15 mg/kg bw per day (6 weeks). Comparison
of patients receiving stevioside with those on placebo showed neither antihypertensive nor adverse effects of stevioside. This study was approved by the local
ethics committee and met the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki (Ferri et
al., 2006). The product in this study also did not meet the proposed specification.
According to a study available in abstract form only, a randomized placebocontrolled double-blind control study was conducted in subjects with type 2
diabetes. Fifty-five subjects received 500 mg stevioside (purity unspecified) or
placebo (maize starch) 3 times daily for 3 months. Compared with the placebo,
stevioside did not reduce the incremental area under the glucose response curve
and maintained the insulin response and HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels.
HbA1c is an indicator of mean glucose levels and is used in identifying effects on the
control of diabetes. No difference in lipids or blood pressure was observed. It is not
clear whether this study was approved by the local ethics committee or met the
requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki (Jeppesen et al., 2006).
A number of other studies were available on steviol-related material of
unspecified composition, for which the administered dose of steviol could not be
identified or the reports were insufficiently detailed to make an assessment of
their quality (Oviedo et al., 1970; Alvarez et al., 1981; Boeckh & Humboldt, 1981;
Boeckh-Haebisch, 1992; Hsieh et al., 2003).
In addition, a study of skin prick allergy testing with 10% stevioside
conducted in infants (50 per group, aged 4 months to 2 years) indicated a higher
prevalence of sensitization to stevioside in infants with allergic diseases compared
with healthy infants (Kimata, 2007).
At the current meeting, the Committee was presented with the results of
additional studies in human volunteers, including those that were in progress at the
time of the sixty-eighth meeting.
A placebo-controlled double-blind trial was carried out in 49 hyperlipidaemic
patients (aged 20–70 years, number of males and females not supplied) not
undergoing treatment. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and
complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Individuals were divided
into two groups, with 24 subjects receiving placebo capsules and 25 receiving
capsules containing a dose of 50 mg steviol glycosides (70% stevioside, 20%
rebaudioside A), equivalent to 1.04 mg steviol/kg bw per day, using the mean body
weight of the treatment group, 72.7 kg. Two capsules were taken before lunch and
two before dinner each day for 90 days. Six subjects withdrew from the study, four

202

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

in the placebo group and two in the test group. Self-reported adverse reactions were
recorded, and fasting blood samples were taken at the end of the study and
analysed for ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase
(GGT), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein
(LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides. No effects of treatment
on ALT, AST or GGT were found. Decreases in the total cholesterol and LDL were
observed in both the stevioside group and the placebo group, which were not
treatment related. No adverse effects were observed (Cavalcante da Silva et al.,
2006). The Committee noted at its sixty-eighth meeting that the product used in this
study did not meet the proposed specification.
A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial was
carried out in 122 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (62 male and 60 female
subjects aged 33–75 years). The study was compliant with ethics guidelines of the
International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Subjects were allocated into two
groups: one group received 1000 mg rebaudioside A (97.4% rebaudioside A, remaining content other steviol glycosides) per day, and the other group received a
placebo. All subjects consumed four capsules daily, two with breakfast and two with
the evening meal, for 16 weeks. Based on the mean body weight of the test subjects
at the beginning of the study, the mean rebaudioside A dose was 10.2 mg/kg bw
per day, corresponding to 3.4 mg/kg bw per day expressed as steviol. Vital signs
and adverse events were recorded at each clinic visit, along with changes in the
laboratory assessments. HbA1c was measured in weeks 0 and 16. Two individuals
in the test group withdrew from the study (owing to gastrointestinal haemorrhage
and hyperglycaemia), and four in the placebo group withdrew. The reasons for
withdrawal were not considered to be treatment related. Twenty-seven subjects
receiving the test compound experienced one or more adverse events, compared
with 23 in the placebo group. Four further events in the test group and three in the
placebo group were considered to be severe in intensity. These events included
influenza-like symptoms, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage (a serious
adverse event) and a cyst in the rebaudioside A group; and gastroenteritis, fracture
and bronchitis in the placebo group. These were considered to be unrelated to
treatment. There was no evidence of any adverse effects of treatment on blood
pressure, serum chemistry and haematology parameters, or urinalysis. HbA1c was
unaffected by treatment. The authors concluded that a daily dose of 1000 mg
rebaudioside A did not cause pharmacological effects in this population of diabetic
subjects and had no effect on diabetic control. The authors stated that they did not
investigate the effects of rebaudioside A on individuals with type 1 diabetes because
the purported mechanism of action for steviol glycosides involves enhanced
secretion of insulin from the pancreas when there is impaired response to glucose
stimulation (Wheeler, 2007a; Carakostas et al., 2008; Maki et al., 2008b).
A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial was carried
out in two subgroups of individuals: 45 healthy subjects with normal glucose
tolerance (28 female, 17 male, BMI 27.3 ± 0.8 kg/m2) and 48 individuals with type
2 diabetes mellitus (13 female, 35 male, BMI 32.2 ± 0.6 kg/m2). Subjects were aged
18–74 years, and mean body weight was 78.7 ± 2.7 kg for subjects with normal

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

203

glucose tolerance and 96.1 ± 2.2 kg for subjects with diabetes. The study was compliant with ICH ethics guidelines and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Participants
received either rebaudioside A (97.4% rebaudioside A, remaining content other
steviol glycosides) or placebo on two separate occasions, 1 week apart. Doses
were randomly assigned, with individuals receiving 500 mg, 750 mg or 1000 mg
rebaudioside A or placebo; all individuals received one dose of rebaudioside A
and one placebo dose. Based on the mean body weight of the test subjects at
the beginning of the study, the mean doses of rebaudioside A were 6.4, 9.5 and
12.7 mg/kg bw (2.1, 3.1 and 4.2 mg/kg bw expressed as steviol) for subjects with
normal glucose tolerance and 5.2, 7.8 and 10.4 mg/kg bw (1.7, 2.6 and 3.4 mg/kg
bw expressed as steviol) for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure,
diet, physical activity, vital signs and adverse events were recorded at each clinic
visit. Blood samples were taken 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 min after
the start of each dose period in all subjects and 270, 300, 330 and 360 min after the
start of each dose period in those with normal glucose tolerance. Blood samples
were analysed for glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon. No statistically
significant differences were found with any parameter at any dose in the test and
control groups in either of the subgroups. The authors concluded that 1000 mg of
rebaudioside A (equivalent to 329 mg steviol) did not have adverse effects on blood
pressure or glucose homeostasis in healthy individuals or individuals with type
2 diabetes mellitus (Maki et al., 2007).
A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial was
carried out in 100 healthy subjects with normal blood pressure (21 males and
79 females aged 18–73 years). The study was compliant with ICH ethics guidelines.
One group received 1000 mg rebaudioside A/day (97.4% purity, equivalent to
4.6 mg/kg bw per day expressed as steviol, based on the mean body weight of the
test subjects), and the other group received a placebo. All subjects consumed four
capsules daily, two with breakfast and two with the evening meal, for 4 weeks. Vital
signs and adverse events were recorded at each clinic visit, along with changes in
the laboratory assessments. Blood pressure was recorded at screening and weekly
during dosing, and assessments were taken when seated, supine and standing.
Twenty-four-hour ambulatory measurements were also taken in weeks 0 and 4. Two
individuals in the placebo group withdrew from the study during dosing, but their
reasons were unrelated to the treatment. Sixteen subjects receiving the test
compound experienced one or more adverse events, compared with 18 in the
placebo group. Only one event in the placebo group was classified as a serious
adverse event, and one event in each group was considered to be severe in
intensity. These events included back pain, headache, rhinitis and upper respiratory
tract infection. All events in the test compound group were considered to be
unrelated or unlikely to be related to the treatment, and one event in the placebo
group (pruritis) was considered to be possibly related to the placebo used. There
was no evidence of any adverse effects of treatment from the haematology,
biochemistry or urinalysis. At week 0, there were no significant differences between
groups in the changes from pre-meal to post-meal values in seated, supine or
standing blood pressures (systolic, diastolic or mean arterial pressure) or heart rate.
At week 4, there were small post-meal increases in some of the blood pressure
parameters in the rebaudioside A group, compared with small decreases in the

204

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

placebo group. The overall treatment effect (change from week 0) was statistically
significantly different from placebo for supine and standing diastolic blood pressure
and mean arterial pressure, but this was not considered to be clinically meaningful
(Wheeler, 2007b; Maki et al., 2008a).
An additional pre-specified analysis to address the questions raised by the
Committee at its sixty-third meeting focused on the subgroup of 20 control and 28
test subjects (dose adjusted for mean body weight of subgroup = 4.7 mg/kg bw per
day expressed as steviol) with baseline systolic blood pressure below the sexspecific medians (baseline <108 mmHg [14.4 kPa] in females and <117 mmHg
[15.6 kPa] in males). These values are below the mean values of 124 mmHg
(16.5 kPa) in the United States population aged 40–59 years (Ong et al., 2007) and
could therefore be classified as low-normal. It was considered that asymptomatic
hypotensive individuals are extremely difficult to identify, and thus focusing on this
subgroup was considered to be the most feasible approach to addressing the
Committee’s requirements (Carakostas et al., 2008). In this subgroup, there was
no significant difference between rebaudioside A and placebo groups for change
in seated systolic blood pressure and a slight, but statistically significant, reduction
from baseline to treatment for rebaudioside A compared with placebo in seated
mean arterial pressure (í0.28 mmHg [í0.037 kPa] versus ±1.53 mmHg [±0.20 kPa],
P = 0.036). The authors concluded that rebaudioside A did not cause
haemodynamic changes in volunteers with normal or low-normal blood pressure
(Wheeler, 2007b; Maki et al., 2008a).

DIETARY EXPOSURE

3.1

Introduction

The dietary exposure to steviol glycosides was evaluated by the sixty-third
meeting of the Committee. For the present meeting, the Committee evaluated new
information on the dietary exposure to steviol glycosides submitted by a sponsor.
Additional information was taken from the report of the sixty-third meeting of the
Committee. All of the dietary exposure results are presented in terms of equivalents
of steviol, based on a conversion of 40% from the steviol glycoside, stevioside, or
33% from rebaudioside A.
3.2

Use in foods

Steviol glycosides are used to sweeten a number of foods in China, Japan
and South America. It is also known that Stevia leaves are used to prepare a
sweetened tea in a number of countries throughout the world. The proposed food
uses evaluated at the sixty-third meeting are shown in Table 3. The additional
information on dietary exposure submitted to the present meeting of the Committee
contained proposed additional uses in numerous food categories. The new proposed uses include all those for aspartame use currently approved by the European
Union. Table 4 summarizes the proposed uses and use levels, based on the categorization scheme used in the General Standard for Food Additives of the Codex
Alimentarius Commission.

International estimates of dietary exposure

At the sixty-third meeting of the Committee, the WHO Global Environment
Monitoring System – Food Contamination Monitoring and Assessment Programme
(GEMS/Food) database was used to prepare international estimates of dietary
exposure for steviol glycosides (as steviol). It was assumed that steviol glycosides
would replace all sweeteners used in or as food, reflecting the minimum reported

208

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

relative sweetness between steviol glycosides and sucrose of 200:1. At that time,
the GEMS/Food international diets that were available were restricted to five
geographical areas: Middle East, Far East, Africa, Europe and Latin America. The
dietary exposures to steviol glycosides estimated using these data ranged from 1.3
to 3.5 mg/kg bw per day.
The current GEMS/Food international diets have been derived for 13 clusters
of nations, based on similar dietary preferences (accessed online, 20 May 2008, at
http://www.who.int/foodsafety/chem/gems/en/index1.html). Using the same assumptions as those employed by the sixty-third meeting (i.e. that steviol glycosides
would replace all sweeteners used in or as food, at a ratio of 200:1 based on
equivalent sweetness), the present Committee has calculated that international
dietary exposure to steviol glycosides ranges from 0.9 mg/kg bw per day (cluster J)
to 5 mg/kg bw per day (clusters B and M).
The estimates are shown in Table 5. These estimates are conservative, in
that it is very unlikely that users of steviol glycosides would replace all commodity
sweeteners found in their diets.

National estimates of dietary exposure

The sixty-third meeting of the Committee evaluated national dietary
exposure estimates submitted by Japan and additionally derived estimates using
production tonnage reported by China and national sugar consumption data from

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

209

the USA and Japan. The per capita consumption of steviol glycosides in China,
based on production information submitted to the Committee, was lower than that
calculated for Japan and was not further elaborated. These estimates are
summarized in Table 6.

These estimates were prepared in parallel to those for the international estimates: it was
assumed that all dietary sugars in diets in Japan and the USA would be replaced by steviol
glycosides, at a ratio of 200:1.

A new dietary exposure analysis was submitted to the present meeting of
the Committee by a sponsor. Three estimate types were prepared. The first
paralleled the per capita analysis completed at the sixty-third meeting. The per
capita consumption of caloric sweeteners from the USA, 176 g/day, taken from a
United States Department of Agriculture publication, was converted to a steviol
glycosides dietary exposure estimate using the 200:1 sweetness ratio and
assuming complete replacement of caloric sweeteners with steviol glycosides. This
estimate was 4.8 mg/kg bw per day using the relative molecular mass of
rebaudioside A or 5.8 mg/kg bw per day using the relative molecular mass of
stevioside, to convert to steviol equivalents.
The second analysis type was based on the principle of sweetness equivalency. In this analysis, it is assumed that steviol glycosides, which are approximately
equivalent in sweetness to aspartame at dilutions typically found in beverages,
would replace aspartame milligram for milligram in all foods for which aspartame
use is currently allowed (one additional use was included: in soya beverages at
levels up to 1000 mg/kg). Because the market for aspartame in the USA is mature
and detailed dietary exposure surveys have been conducted specifically for
aspartame over the past 2 decades, it was concluded that the estimate of dietary
exposure for steviol glycosides based on these survey data would be realistic. The
dietary exposures, prepared using these assumptions and shown in Table 7, range
from 0.4 mg/kg bw per day for a non-diabetic consumer at the mean to 1.7 mg/kg
bw per day for a non-diabetic consumer at or above the 90th percentile (Renwick,
2008).
The third analysis contained an updated international dietary exposure that
used only the five regional diets from the older GEMS/Food database. The newer
international estimate prepared at this meeting supersedes this analysis, which was
not further considered.

Summary of dietary exposures

Table 8 contains a summary of the dietary exposures to steviol glycosides
evaluated or derived by the Committee at the sixty-third and present meetings. The
present Committee concurred with the conclusion of the sixty-third meeting that the
replacement estimates were highly conservative and that dietary exposure to steviol
glycosides (as steviol) would likely be 20–30% of these values (i.e. 1–2 mg/kg bw
per day). This range is consistent with the survey-derived estimates submitted to
the current meeting.

The toxicokinetic studies confirmed that intact stevioside and rebaudioside
A are poorly absorbed, but they are hydrolysed by the intestinal microflora to steviol,
which is well absorbed. After absorption, steviol is metabolized mainly to steviol
glucuronide, which is excreted in the urine of humans. In rats, steviol glucuronide
is excreted in the bile and deconjugated in the lower intestine, before elimination as
steviol in the faeces. Pharmacokinetic parameters indicate that systemic exposure

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

211

to steviol is greater after administration of stevioside than after administration of
rebaudioside A in rats, whereas systemic exposure in humans is primarily to steviol
glucuronide and is similar for stevioside and rebaudioside A.
The older studies identified in the submission mainly involved material of
unknown composition or not meeting the present specification and were not
informative for the evaluation. The results of the new studies in animals were
consistent with the results of previous studies. In two new 13-week studies in rats
fed diets containing rebaudioside A, no adverse effects were observed at dietary
concentrations of up to 36 000 mg/kg and up to 50 000 mg/kg, respectively. The
latter concentration is considered to be a NOEL, equal to doses of 4161 mg/kg bw
per day in males and 4645 mg/kg bw per day in females, expressed as rebaudioside
A (1370 mg/kg bw per day in males and 1530 mg/kg bw per day in females,
expressed as steviol).
At its fifty-first meeting, the Committee reviewed a number of studies of reproductive and developmental toxicity with stevioside and Stevia extracts and noted
that administration of stevioside (purity 90–96%) at doses of up to 2500 mg/kg bw
per day in hamsters and 3000 mg/kg bw per day in rats had no effect. The Committee also noted that, although an aqueous infusion of S. rebaudiana administered orally to female rats was reported to cause a severe, long-lasting reduction in
fertility, the contraceptive effect of Stevia was probably not due to stevioside.
Stevioside (purity 95.6%) had neither teratogenic nor embryotoxic effects at doses
of up to 1000 mg/kg bw per day in rats treated by gavage. The multigeneration study
of reproductive toxicity reviewed at the present meeting did not reveal adverse
effects with rebaudioside A at the highest dose tested, 2048–4066 mg/kg bw per
day (674–1339 mg/kg bw per day expressed as steviol). This supports the previous
conclusion of the Committee that administration of steviol glycosides was unlikely
to be associated with adverse reproductive effects.
The new studies in humans were designed to address the issues that the
Committee raised at its sixty-third meeting concerning evidence to demonstrate that
the putative pharmacological effects of steviol glycosides would not be found at the
exposure levels resulting from the proposed use as a food additive.
Steviol glycosides did not have adverse effects on diabetic control or on
blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes given 1000 mg of rebaudioside A
per day (mean dose of rebaudioside A, 10.2 mg/kg bw per day, equivalent to
3.4 mg/kg bw per day expressed as steviol) for 16 weeks. No studies were
conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, the Committee at its present
meeting noted that the purported mechanism of action of steviol glycosides on
glucose homeostasis involves enhanced secretion of insulin from the pancreas
when there is impaired response to glucose stimulation. In contrast, type 1 diabetes
is characterized by a permanent inability of the pancreatic ȕ-cell to produce insulin,
and therefore effects of steviol glycosides were considered unlikely in this subgroup.
No clinically significant changes in blood pressure parameters were seen in
normotensive individuals or in a subset of these individuals with blood pressure
below the median who took rebaudioside A at a dose of 1000 mg/day (mean dose
of rebaudioside A, 14 mg/kg bw per day, or 4.6 mg/kg bw per day expressed as
steviol) for 4 weeks.

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

Assessment of dietary exposure

The Committee evaluated information on dietary exposure to steviol
glycosides from its sixty-third meeting and additional information concerning potential dietary exposure to rebaudioside A submitted by a sponsor. All the exposure
results are presented in terms of equivalents of steviol, based on a conversion of
40% from the steviol glycoside, stevioside (relative molecular mass: steviol, 318;
stevioside, 805), or 33% from rebaudioside A (relative molecular mass 967).
The Committee used the GEMS/Food database to prepare updated
international estimates of dietary exposure to steviol glycosides (as steviol). It was
assumed that steviol glycosides would replace all dietary sugars at the lowest
reported relative sweetness ratio for steviol glycosides and sucrose, 200:1. The
dietary exposures ranged from 0.9 mg/kg bw per day (cluster J) to 5 mg/kg bw per
day (clusters B and M). The Committee also evaluated estimates of dietary
exposure per capita derived from disappearance (poundage) data supplied by
Japan and China.
The Committee evaluated an estimate of dietary exposure to steviol
glycosides based on the replacement of all dietary sugars in the USA. Using a per
capita estimate of 176 g of caloric sweetener per day, the Committee calculated that
the consumption of steviol glycosides would be 5.8 mg/kg bw per day. Additionally,
published estimates of exposure to rebaudioside A, based on exposure to other
high-intensity sweeteners and using the principle of equivalent sweetness, were
evaluated by the Committee. These estimates were 1.5 mg/kg bw per day for
diabetic children and adults and 1.7 mg/kg bw per day for non-diabetic children
consuming the sweetener at a high percentile of the exposure distribution, taken to
be greater than the 90th percentile.
Table 8 in section 3.5 summarizes the exposures to steviol glycosides (as
steviol) evaluated or derived by the sixty-third and current meetings of the
Committee.
The Committee concluded that the replacement estimates were highly
conservative and that dietary exposure to steviol glycosides (as steviol) would likely
be 20–30% of these values. The published estimates based on equivalent sweetness were taken as more representative of probable dietary exposure at a high
percentile of the exposure distribution.

EVALUATION

From a long-term study with stevioside, which had already been discussed by the Committee at its fifty-first meeting, a NOEL1 of 970 mg/kg bw per day
was identified. At its sixty-third meeting, the Committee set a temporary ADI of
0–2 mg/kg bw for steviol glycosides, expressed as steviol, on the basis of this NOEL
for stevioside of 970 mg/kg bw per day (383 mg/kg bw per day expressed as
steviol) and a safety factor of 200, pending further information. The further
information was required because the Committee had noted that stevioside had
1

STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES (addendum)

213

shown some evidence of pharmacological effects in patients with hypertension or
with type 2 diabetes at doses corresponding to about 12.5–25.0 mg/kg bw per day
(5–10 mg/kg bw per day expressed as steviol).
The results of the new studies presented to the Committee at its present
meeting have shown no adverse effects of steviol glycosides when taken at doses
of about 4 mg/kg bw per day, expressed as steviol, for up to 16 weeks by individuals
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and individuals with normal or low-normal blood
pressure for 4 weeks. The Committee concluded that the new data were sufficient
to allow the additional safety factor of 2 and the temporary designation to be
removed and established an ADI for steviol glycosides of 0–4 mg/kg bw expressed
as steviol.
The Committee noted that some estimates of high-percentile dietary
exposure to steviol glycosides exceeded the ADI, particularly when assuming
complete replacement of caloric sweeteners with steviol glycosides, but recognized
that these estimates were highly conservative and that actual intakes were likely to
be within the ADI range.

EXPLANATION

Dietary exposure to sulfites was evaluated by the Committee at its present
meeting at the request of the Codex Committee on Food Additives (CCFA) at its
Thirty-ninth Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007a). The Committee was
asked to consider all data necessary for the assessment of dietary exposure from
all foods, including use levels, owing to concern that the acceptable daily intake
(ADI) might be exceeded.
Sulfites have a number of technological functions, including antioxidant,
bleaching agent, flour treatment agent and preservative, and are used in a wide
variety of applications in the food industry. The terms “sulfites” and “sulfiting
agents” usually refer to the gas sulfur dioxide and sodium, potassium and calcium
sulfites, hydrogen sulfites and metabisulfites. Throughout the present report, the
concentration of sulfites in food is expressed as sulfur dioxide.
Sulfur dioxide and sulfites were evaluated by the Committee at its sixth,
eighth, ninth, seventeenth, twenty-seventh, thirtieth and fifty-first meetings
(Annex 1, references 6, 8, 11, 32, 62, 73 and 137). At its seventeenth meeting, the
Committee established an ADI for sulfites of 0–0.7 mg/kg body weight (bw),
expressed as sulfur dioxide.

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

In its last evaluation of sulfites at the fifty-first meeting, the Committee noted
that potential dietary exposures based on maximum levels (MLs)1 proposed in the
draft Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) and on national mean
food consumption data exceeded the ADI in the three Member States that submitted
such data. Six Member States also submitted data in which dietary exposure was
assessed on the basis of MLs in their national regulations and on mean food
consumptions; mean potential dietary exposure of consumers of food containing
sulfites did not exceed the ADI. The potential for high-percentile consumers of foods
containing sulfites to exceed the ADI was shown to exist, but available data were
insufficient to estimate the number of such consumers or the magnitude and
duration of intake greater than the ADI.
A review of all permitted food additives was undertaken as part of the review
of the Australian Food Standards Code (Australia New Zealand Food Authority,
2002; Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2006). Within this review, sulfites
were identified as a cause for health concern because the estimated dietary
exposures to these preservatives had the potential to exceed the ADI both in
the whole population and in specific population subsets. Consequently, it was
recommended that the concentration of sulfites in food and the dietary exposure to
sulfites should be monitored. Therefore, sulfites were selected for assessment in
the 21st Australian Total Diet Study (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2005),
and Australia requested the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants
(CCFAC, later split into CCFA and the Codex Committee on Contaminants in Food
[CCCF]) at its Thirty-eighth Session (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2006) to put
a dietary exposure assessment of sulfites on the priority list for evaluation by the
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The Thirty-ninth
Session of CCFA reconfirmed the inclusion of sulfites on the priority list as a high
priority (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007a).
As sulfites are known to cause adverse reactions in specific subsets of the
population, there are specific provisions in the Codex General Standard for the
Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 1991) and in
national legislation in a number of countries for the labelling of foods and beverages
containing sulfites (e.g. in Directive 2003/89/EC; European Commission, 2003).
This issue and that of the potential acute toxicity of sulfites in general were not dealt
with by the Committee at its present meeting, which focused on long-term dietary
exposure, in line with the CCFA request.

CHEMISTRY AND ANALYTICAL METHODS

2.1

Chemistry

The additives listed under sulfites in the current Codex GSFA are sulfur
dioxide (International Numbering System [INS] 220), sodium sulfite (INS 221),
sodium hydrogen sulfite (INS 222), sodium metabisulfite (INS 223), potassium
metabisulfite (INS 224), potassium sulfite (INS 225), calcium hydrogen sulfite

Throughout the present report, the term maximum level (ML) is used to represent any
maximum level set for a regulatory purpose at a national or international level.

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

223

(INS 227), potassium bisulfite (INS 228) and sodium thiosulfate (INS 539). Sulfites
are added to foods such as processed meats, dried fruit, wine, beer, fruit and
vegetable juices, water-based flavoured drinks and processed fish and seafoods,
with the major functions of preservation and inhibition of browning reactions. The
ability of sulfites to prevent further oxidation of polyphenols is especially important
in wine production, where these components are considered to contribute to the
taste, texture and colour of the final product (Burroughs, 1981; Ough, 1986). Sulfites
may also occur naturally in some foods, especially in fermented ones, as a result
of endogenous formation by yeast during the fermentation process (Taylor et al.,
1986).
Sulfites may be present in food as sulfurous acid, inorganic sulfites and a
variety of reversibly and irreversibly combined forms. They react rapidly with a
variety of food constituents, including reducing sugars, aldehydes, ketones and
proteins, to form various combined sulfites, such as the highly stable
hydroxysulfonate adducts. The amount of compound in each of these states is
dependent on a number of factors, including the food matrix and the pH. Sulfites
reversibly bound may dissociate into free sulfite when the food pH is raised above
10 or when acidified solutions are heated until boiling (Ough, 1986; Fazio & Warner,
1990; Lück & Jager, 1997). Adducts irreversibly bound are usually formed by the
reaction of sulfites with alkanes or aromatic compounds, giving rise to sulfonic acids,
which are not recovered when the sulfited food is submitted to alkaline conditions
or upon distillation in acid medium. The fraction of sulfites that does not bind to food
constituents is called “free sulfite”, constituting a mixture of sulfur dioxide, bisulfite
and sulfite ions in a dynamic equilibrium. This fraction is rapidly converted to
molecular sulfur dioxide when the sulfited food is acidified (Wedzicha, 1992). As
sulfites react with a variety of food constituents and some are lost during processing
and storage, their use levels may not represent the amount needed to ensure an
effective residual level through the shelf life of the product and may not reflect
the concentration remaining in a food at the time of ingestion (Taylor et al., 1986;
Annex 1, reference 137). The fate of added sulfites is highly dependent on the
chemical nature of the food, the type and extent of storage conditions, the
permeability of the package and the level of addition. The combination with organic
constituents, the equilibrium between the various inorganic forms, the volatilization
of sulfur dioxide and the oxidation to sulfates are all important reactions, and their
relative importance will depend mostly on the food involved (Fazio & Warner,1990).
2.2

Analytical methods

Analytical methods for the determination of sulfites in food have been
reviewed (Fazio & Warner, 1990; Karavicová & Simko, 1996). Published methods
are generally based on the known chemistry and reactivity of sulfites with the matrix
and require some means of recovering sulfur dioxide. They fall into two basic
categories: methods that require an initial distillation of the test sample to free the
sulfur dioxide, and those that use a non-distillation reaction to achieve the same
end-point (Wedzicha et al., 1984; Wedzicha, 1992). Several methods use acidic or
basic solutions (AOAC International, 1995a, 1995b, 1995c, 1995d, 1995e, 1995f),

224

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

and most of the procedures are based on the conversion of the various forms of
sulfites into sulfur dioxide (Fazio & Warner, 1990; Warner et al., 2000).
The AOAC Monier-Williams method (AOAC International, 1995a) is the
procedure most widely used for the determination of sulfites in foods and beverages
and has been the reference method with which new methods have been compared
for accuracy and precision. Modifications that have been made to this method aim
either to achieve a lower level of determination (AOAC International, 1995c) or to
make it applicable to particular matrices, such as dried garlic (Lafeuille et al., 2007).
The minor procedural changes to the Monier-Williams method (AOAC International,
1995a) introduced by the United States Food and Drug Administration (AOAC
International, 1995c) reduced the concentration of the titrant by a factor of 10 to
permit more accurate measurement of the volume and specified values for
condenser coolant temperature, reflux ratio and nitrogen flow to reduce the risk of
interfering substances. A statistical evaluation of the results from intralaboratory,
interlaboratory and collaborative studies established that this procedure is capable
of determining sulfites in foods at a level of 10 mg/kg (Hillery et al., 1989). It is
applicable to foods in the presence of other volatile compounds, but it is not
applicable to dried onions, leeks or cabbages (AOAC International, 1995c). The
reference method adopted by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine to
measure free and total sulfites in wines is also a modification of the Monier-Williams
procedure (International Organisation of Vine and Wine, 2008).
Available enzymatic methods for sulfites use the enzyme sulfite oxidase
(Enzyme Commission [EC] 1.8.3.1) and are based upon relatively nonspecific
ultraviolet and oxygen measurements. Commercial kits are available in which the
sulfite in the test portion is enzymatically oxidized by oxygen to form sulfate and
hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) in the presence of NADH peroxidase. The decrease in NADH is proportional
to the sulfite concentration (Beutler, 1984). However, the sensitivity of these kits
may be a limitation in measuring sulfites at levels of 50 mg/kg (Fazio & Warner,
1990). The direct determination of sulfite in biscuits, beer, soup and vinegar by a
biosensor based on plant tissue homogenate (Malva vulgaris) containing sulfite
oxidase was more recently described (Sezgintürk & Dinçkaya, 2005).
Various high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) systems have
been used for the determination of sulfites in foods. After HPLC separation, different
systems are used for sulfite detection. These offer the advantage of a lower
detection limit as well as reduction of the analysis time from 2–3 h to 12–25 min
(Williams et al., 1992; Karavicová & Simko, 1996; McFeeters & Barish, 2003). A
sensitive and selective analytical technique for the determination of free and total
sulfites in foods was developed using ion chromatography with electrochemical
detection (Kim & Kim, 1986). This method, which was adopted as an Official Method
by AOAC International (1995f), determines sulfur dioxide at 10mg/kg and is not
applicable to dark-coloured foods or ingredients where sulfur dioxide is strongly
bound. Headspace liquid chromatography with amperometric detection was used
by Lawrence & Chadha (1987, 1988) to determine sulfite in a variety of foods. The
detection limits were about 1 μg/g, based on a 15-g sample. Three liquid
chromatographic methods employing amperometric detection (one employing

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

225

headspace, another direct ion exchange and the third direct ion exclusion) were
used to determine total sulfites in different foods. All methods produced similar
results and could detect sulfites at levels as low as 1 μg/g in four of the five types
of food (Lawrence et al., 1990). An HPLC method with indirect photometry was
reported to be reliable to determine sulfur dioxide levels of 5–10 mg/kg in foods
(Pizzoferrato et al., 1990, 1998). An alternative chromatographic method based
upon a combination of a modified Monier-Williams procedure and an ion
chromatographic separation and quantification of total sulfite in foods was
developed by Ruiz et al. (1994).
A differential pulse polarographic method (AOAC International, 1995b) has
been collaboratively tested and is applicable to the determination of sulfur dioxide
levels of 10 mg/kg in shrimp, orange juice, peas, dried apricots and dehydrated
potatoes. Alternative chemical methods for the determination of sulfites include flow
injection analytical systems coupled with spectrophotometric, electrochemical and
chemiluminescence detections (Sullivan et al., 1986; Lin & Hobo, 1996; DecnopWeever & Kraak, 1997; Safavi & Haghighi, 1997; Corbo & Bertotti, 2002; Araújo et
al., 2005) and capillary electrophoresis (Trenerry, 1996; Masár et al., 2004).
Methods based on capillary electrophoresis have often been considered faster and
more cost effective than other instrumental techniques, with the added advantage
that most determinations can be carried out using the same fused silica capillary
column. The method described by Trenerry (1996) had a limit of detection of 5 mg/
kg and was found to be suitable for measuring sulfite content in a variety of foods
and beverages, including samples that are not traditionally analysed by the MonierWilliams procedure. Perfetti & Diachenko (2003) described a method for
determining sulfite in dried garlic. Garlic is extracted with a hydrochloric acid
solution to inhibit the formation of allicin, which interferes with the determination of
sulfite. After cleanup of the extract on a C18 solid-phase extraction column, sulfite
is converted to hydroxymethylsulfonate by adding formaldehyde and heating to
50 °C. Hydroxymethylsulfonate is determined by reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid
chromatography with post-column detection. Recovery of hydroxymethylsulfonate
from spiked garlic averaged 94.8%, with a coefficient of variation of 3.8%.
In conclusion, several methods are available for the determination of
sulfites in foods and beverages, the choice of method depending, among other
factors, on the matrix to be analysed and the expected concentration of sulfite.
The most common methods in use to date involve distillation of sulfur dioxide from
a highly acidified sample, followed by titration, colorimetric, polarographic or ion
chromatographic determination. The iodometric titration methods are not
considered very useful for low analyte concentrations, and the enzymatic methods
using commercial kits offer less sensitivity. To fill the gap when the Monier-Williams
method is not applicable, alternative methods based on HPLC, ion chromatography,
capillary electrophoresis and flow injection analytical techniques have been
developed. In this context, various detection techniques, such as spectrophotometry, amperometry, potentiometry and chemiluminescence, have been
applied. Whatever test procedures have been adopted by laboratories, they need
in-house validation, and the results should be compared with a reference method.
It is essential for laboratories to implement a well documented internal quality control

226

system and participate in an appropriate proficiency testing programme or
interlaboratory comparison to authenticate the accuracy and reliability of data
produced.

In the current GSFA, most provisions for solid foods are in the range of
15–500 mg/kg. Most provisions for liquid foods are in the range of 50–200 mg/kg.
Examples of solid foods for which there are provisions in the current Codex
GSFA are processed vegetables (up to 500 mg/kg), processed fish and seafood (up
to 150 mg/kg) and processed fruit (up to 1000 mg/kg in dried fruit). Examples of
liquid foods for which there are provisions are alcoholic drinks, including beer (up
to 50 mg/l) and wine (up to 350 mg/l), fruit and vegetable juices (up to 50 mg/l) and
water-based flavoured drinks (up to 70 mg/l).
CCFA adopted MLs that are lower than the draft MLs that were used for the
assessment of dietary exposure to sulfites performed by the Committee at its fiftyfirst meeting. For example, for the category 04.1.2.2 “dried fruit”, the draft ML was
5000 mg/kg and the ML in the current Codex GSFA is 1000 mg/kg.
In most national legislation that regulates the use of sulfites, there are
provisions for the same solid and liquid foods as in the current GSFA. The MLs set
in some national regulations are higher than the MLs in the current GSFA for a
number of categories of foods and beverages. This is the case for dried fruit (2000
mg/kg in the EU and Republic of Korea and 3000 mg/kg in Australia and New
Zealand versus 1000 mg/kg in the current GSFA), dried vegetables (3000 mg/kg in
Australia and New Zealand versus 500 mg/kg in the current GSFA) and lemon juice
(350 mg/l in the EU versus 50 mg/l in the current GSFA).
The Committee noted that there are no provisions for the use of sulfites for
any meat product either in the current GSFA or in Codex commodity standards. On
the other hand, there are provisions for processed meats in some national legislation
made available to the Committee. Sulfites are known to destroy thiamine. For this
reason, the use of sulfites in foods that are considered an important source of
thiamine, such as meat products, is not permitted in some countries (e.g. Brazil) or
is permitted only for limited applications (e.g. in the EU, sulfites can be used only in
breakfast sausages and burger meats with vegetables and/or cereals, at a ML of
450 mg/kg, but cannot be used in burger meat in general). In Australia and New
Zealand, sulfites can be used at up to 500 mg/kg in broader categories: in burger
meat in general and in all sausages containing raw meat.
3.2

Data made available to the Committee

Data were made available to the Committee for the present evaluation
through submissions by Australia, Brazil, Germany and the United States of
America (USA). The Comité Européen des Fabricants de Sucre sent general
comments on the sugar-related provisions in the current GSFA, but without any
specific information in relation to dietary exposure. The data presented in these
submissions were complemented with data from the literature referring to France,
Italy, Lebanon and the United Kingdom. Only data published since the last
evaluation of sulfites by the Committee in 2000 were considered in the present
evaluation. Therefore, the data presented in the submission by the USA, which
predated 2000, were not considered.

228

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

The data used by the Committee in the present evaluation comprise data on
the concentration of sulfites in foods and beverages and on dietary exposure
assessments based on model diets, individual food surveys and a total diet study
(TDS). They are summarized in Table 2.

Concentration of sulfites in foods and beverages

Australia (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2005), Brazil (Machado,
2007a, 2007c) and Germany (Fricke, 2007) submitted to the Committee recent
analytical data on the concentration of sulfites in foods available on their markets.
Further analytical data referring to foods available on the markets of the United
Kingdom (Food Standards Agency, 2004) and Italy (Leclercq et al., 2000) were
made available to the Committee.
Data on occurrence/use levels of sulfites in foods available on the French
market, as reported by the food industry, were also made available to the Committee
(Bemrah et al., 2008).
All these data are presented in Appendix 1.
Information on the concentration of sulfites in foods and beverages available
on the market and, where applicable, after cooking is very useful to complement the
information on MLs in Codex and national legislation, since it allows the assessment
of current levels of exposure rather than potential levels of exposure in the
population. In fact, as for other additives, sulfites may not be used in all items for
which there are provisions and could be used at levels differing from the MLs.
The Committee noted that the concentrations of sulfites determined
analytically do not always reflect their concentration in foods at the time of ingestion
owing to losses during the processing and storage of treated foods. For example,
dried vegetables, which may contain up to 500 mg sulfites/kg, according to the
current GSFA, are usually rehydrated and cooked before ingestion, resulting in far

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

229

lower concentrations of sulfites in the vegetables as consumed. Thus, in the data
made available for Italy (Leclercq et al., 2000), sulfites appeared on the label of dried
mushrooms and peeled potatoes in brine but were no longer detectable in the
cooked product (risotto with mushrooms and peeled potatoes with butter,
respectively). In another study, a reduction of 25–50% of sulfites was observed after
1 month of storage of fish products, potatoes and dried fruit (Di Lullo et al., 1987)
and during cooking, with observed reductions of about 40% in cooked burgers
(Armentia-Alvarez et al., 1993), reduction of 70% in Thai noodles (Kingkate et al.,
1981) and reduction to non-detectable levels in dried mushrooms and peeled
potatoes in brine (Leclercq et al., 2000). For this reason, the analytical
determinations of sulfites performed on ready-to-consume foods are most valuable.
Germany submitted analytical data on the concentration of sulfites in a wide
range of foods and beverages present on the German market, and Brazil provided
such data for wine and fruit juice. Further analytical data are related to foods and
beverages present on the markets of the United Kingdom (only for soft drinks and
minced meat) and Italy. In the case of Australia, Italy and Lebanon, analytical
determinations in foods were performed after cooking. Data on occurrence/use
levels of sulfites in foods available on the French market, as reported by the food
industry based on their product recipes, together with analytical determinations in
wine, were made available.
The analytical determinations and reported occurrences suggest that in all
these countries, which belong to different regions of the world, sulfites are frequently
added in many of the categories of foods and beverages for which there are
provisions in the current GSFA.
The analytical data on wine in Brazil, France, Germany and Italy showed that
the average concentration of sulfites may vary according to the country and the type
of wine, but all were in the range of 70–130 mg/l—i.e. they are lower than the
provisions in current GSFA (350 mg/l) or national legislation. Two studies showed
that the current average levels of residue are lower than those found in previous
decades (Leclercq et al., 2000; Bemrah et al., 2008). A limited number of single
samples exceeded the MLs, reaching more than 1000 mg/l.
The analytical data in other foods and beverages show that, in line with MLs
set by national legislation being higher than those set by Codex, mean
concentrations of sulfites can be greater than the MLs of the current GSFA. This is
the case for some non-alcoholic beverages and for dried fruit. Thus, in Brazil, the
mean concentration of sulfites in one type of fruit juice was greater than the ML for
fruit juices in the current GSFA. The same was true for lemon and lime juices and
for barley waters in the United Kingdom. In Australia, the mean concentration of
sulfites in dried fruit ranged from 1200 to 2000 mg/kg, whereas the ML in the current
GSFA is 1000 mg/kg.
In Australia, sulfites are largely used in sausages containing raw beef and in
burger meat, with average concentrations in the range of 100–300 mg/kg.
The observed mean concentrations of sulfites in some food categories were
found to be close to the national MLs, and the concentrations of sulfites in single

230

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

samples occasionally exceeded the MLs. This was shown to occur for fruit
juice, dried fruit, potato-based snacks, mustard and fine bakery wares. Mean
concentrations that were greater than the national MLs were identified in some food
categories, suggesting either more frequent or more significant excesses. This was
the case for dried tomatoes and horseradish in Germany and for fruit fingers in
Australia. In Lebanon, the mean concentration of sulfites was in excess of the ML
in the current GSFA for biscuits and crackers. Some analytical data provided to the
Committee were related to the illegal use of sulfites in minced meat in Scotland
(Mackie, 2005) and Australia (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2005).
Sulfites are not authorized for this use in the current national legislation of these
countries (although they were authorized in Scotland until 1977).
Prior to 1977, the regulations in force in Scotland allowed minced meat to
contain up to 450 mg sulfites/kg during the months of June, July, August and
September. The current regulations (United Kingdom Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food et al., 1995) do not permit the addition of sulfites to minced meat.
However, owing to the original dispensation, the non-permitted addition of sulfur
dioxide to minced meat has continued to be found to occur occasionally.
In Australia, the Food Standards Code does not permit the addition of
sulfites to minced meat. Of the 15 composite samples of minced meat analysed in
the 21st Australian Total Diet Study, sulfites were detected in four samples,
with concentrations ranging from <5 to 105 mg/kg (Food Standards Australia New
Zealand, 2005).
3.4

Screening by the budget method

The budget method is generally used as a screening method at the first step
of the assessment of dietary exposure in the evaluations of food additives performed
by the Committee. It is used to identify the need for a refined assessment of dietary
exposure. In the present evaluation, the budget method was not applied, since a
refined assessment of dietary exposure had been requested by CCFA.
3.5

Assessment of long-term dietary exposure to sulfites

The dietary exposure assessments made available to the Committee were
based on model diets, individual food surveys and one TDS.
3.5.1 Assessments of long-term dietary exposure based on model diets
Table 3 summarizes the assessments of dietary exposure to sulfites based
on model diets.
Brazil submitted estimates of dietary exposure based on analytical
determination of sulfites in a variety of wines (Machado, 2007a). In all samples, the
concentration of sulfites was below 350 mg/l (ML established in the Brazilian
legislation), with most samples (90%) below 150 mg/l. Dietary exposure to sulfites
from wines was assessed by combining sulfite levels determined analytically with
three hypothetical scenarios of wine consumption: 150, 300 and 450 ml/day. The
dietary exposure to sulfites from regular daily consumption of 150 ml of white wine

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

231

containing sulfites at the mean observed concentration (122 mg/l) covers 43% of
the ADI. Dietary exposure from regular daily consumption of 450 ml of white wine
would be 129% of the ADI. In the case of red wines containing sulfites at the mean
observed concentration (70 mg/l), dietary exposure would be lower, ranging from
29% of the ADI for regular consumption of 150 ml/day to 71% of the ADI for regular
consumption of 450 ml/day.
The Committee noted that the daily consumption of 450 ml of wine is not
an unrealistic scenario, since it corresponds to the observed high-percentile
consumption of wine in countries where it is regularly consumed: the 95th percentile
of consumption in a 7-day nationwide survey in Italy was 450 ml/day (Turrini et al.,
2001), and the 97.5th percentile of consumption in a 7-day nationwide survey in
France was 600 ml/day (Volatier, 2000).
In Italy, 211 samples of foods and beverages (including 85 samples of wine)
were collected among those commercially available in supermarkets (Leclercq
et al., 2000). In the case of foods that require preparation (dried fish, dehydrated
granulated potatoes, etc.), the determination of sulfites was carried out on the
foods after normal domestic preparation according to traditional Italian recipes. A
model diet was developed by combining selected foods and beverages in order to
design realistic meals with the highest possible dietary exposure to sulfites, while
being based on a regular food pattern and on standard portions and recipes. The
European Recommended Dietary Allowances (Commission of the European
Communities, 1993) were used to establish the total daily energy intake in a 30-kg
male child and a 60-kg middle-aged adult male. The sulfite contents of different
meals designed for children and adults were calculated using both EU MLs and
concentrations determined analytically. The total dietary exposures from different
selections of meals (one breakfast plus two main meals plus two between meals)
were calculated. Considering the EU MLs, a daily dietary exposure of 68.3 mg
(2.27 mg/kg bw) could be reached by children, corresponding to 325% of the ADI.
In the adults, a daily dietary exposure of 123.4 mg (2.056 mg/kg bw, 294% of the
ADI) could be reached, considering a consumption of wine of 200 ml/day.
The results obtained by using the analytical data in ready-to-consume foods
and recipes were lower than those obtained by using the MLs. The same
combination of meals used in the above-reported calculations would lead to a
dietary exposure of 23.3 mg/day (0.78 mg/kg bw) in children and 50.3 mg/day
(0.84 mg/kg bw) in adults (both slightly above the ADI, 111% and 120%,
respectively). In children, the main contributor was dried fruit contained in muesli
(contributing to 43% of the ADI, based on daily consumption of 50 g muesli
containing sulfites at 180 mg/kg). In adults, the main contributors were wine
(contributing to 44% of the ADI based on the daily consumption of 200 ml of wine
containing sulfites at 92 mg/l) and peanuts (contributing to 15% of the ADI based
on the daily consumption of 15 g of peanuts containing sulfites at 385 mg/kg). Other
food items were shown to contribute at least 10% of the ADI: beer in adults and, for
children, soft drinks, mashed potatoes and mustard. All these products would be
significant sources of sulfites in the general population, with the exception of soft
drinks, since in Italy only very specific products (for bulk dispensers) would contain
sulfites.

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

3.5.2 Assessment of long-term dietary exposure based on a total diet study
A TDS was performed in Australia (Food Standards Australia New Zealand,
2005) based on a 1-day 24-h recall survey of 13 858 subjects (National Nutrition
Survey conducted in 1995). The population groups considered in the Australian
submission were young girls and boys (aged 2–5 years), schoolgirls and schoolboys
(aged 6–12 years), teenage girls and boys (aged 13–18 years) and adult women
and men (aged 19 years and over). All the foods examined in the study were
prepared as ready to be consumed before analysis. Overall, 90% of the respondents
were consumers of foods or beverages containing sulfites.
The assessment of dietary exposure to sulfites based on this TDS is
summarized in Table 4.
The mean estimated dietary exposures for consumers of foods containing
sulfites ranged from 14% of the ADI for teenage girls to 71% of the ADI for young
boys. Mean estimated dietary exposure for consumers aged 2 years and older was
29% of the ADI for both males and females. The 95th percentile of estimated dietary
exposures exceeded the ADI for most population groups considered, ranging from
86% of the ADI for teenage girls to 271% of the ADI for young boys. The 95th
percentile of estimated dietary exposure for consumers aged 2 years and older,
which could be used to represent the lifetime exposure of high consumers, was
approximately 130% of the ADI for males and females. As usually occurs, the mean
and 95th-percentile dietary exposure estimates expressed per kilogram body weight
were highest for young children and schoolchildren owing to their high food
consumption in relation to body weight.
The major contributors to the mean total dietary exposure to sulfites in
consumers differed between children and adults. In young children, schoolchildren
and teenagers, the three main contributors to mean dietary exposure were beef
sausages (contributing up to 20% of the ADI, according to age and sex), dried
apricots (up to 20%) and cordial (up to 15%). In adults, the main contributors to
mean dietary exposure were white wine (up to 12%), beef sausages (up to 7%) and
dried apricots (up to 6%).
The results of this TDS indicate that mean dietary exposure to sulfites is well
below the ADI, but that in some age groups, dietary exposure to sulfites may exceed
the ADI for a significant proportion of the population.
3.5.3 Assessment of long-term dietary exposure based on individual dietary
surveys
An assessment of dietary exposure to sulfites based on individual dietary
surveys was submitted by Brazil (Machado, 2007b). Additional information from
France (Bemrah et al., 2008) and Lebanon (Soubra et al., 2007) was made available
to the Committee. The assumptions made and the results of the assessments are
summarized in Table 5.

The range represents the minimum and maximum estimated level of dietary exposure to
sulfites depending on the type of fruit juice.

In Brazil, high potential dietary exposure to sulfites from fruit juices
(Machado, 2007b) was assessed by combining individual consumption data
generated by a 24-h dietary recall with sulfite levels determined by chemical analysis
in those fruit juices containing added sulfites (according to the label). Dietary
exposure was expressed in relation to individual body weights in consumers only
(140 subjects). Mean dietary exposure from fruit juices would vary from 16% to 59%
of the ADI, and dietary exposure at the 97.5th percentile would vary from 43% to
155% of the ADI. To simulate a conservative scenario, dietary exposure was also
assessed using national MLs in fruit juices as served to the consumer. The mean
consumption of fruit juices containing sulfites at a ML of 200 mg/l for fruit juice in
general and of 333 mg/l for cashew apple juice could lead to dietary exposure in
excess of the ADI: respectively, 207% and 344%. The results indicate that
teenagers, who are regular high consumers of fruit juices containing sulfites, are
potentially at risk of exceeding the ADI and that in mean consumers, fruit juices
containing sulfites cover a significant portion of the ADI. The Committee noted that,
owing to the small size of the Brazilian sample, the high percentiles that were
assessed bear significant uncertainty and the true high percentile of dietary
exposure could be higher or lower.
In France, dietary exposure to sulfites was estimated by combining national
individual consumption data from the national individual consumption survey
(INCA1) (Volatier, 2000) with the occurrence/use level of sulfites as reported by the
food industry (Bemrah et al., 2008). It was based on two different scenarios. Dietary
exposure was expressed in relation to individual body weights in 2492 subjects
(1474 adults; 1018 children).

238

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

In the first scenario, the mean concentration of sulfites in each food group
was considered, including zero values (overall, 45% of the products considered
were reported to contain no sulfites). This scenario is aimed at representing
consumers who randomly consume foods that do or do not contain food additives.
In the second scenario, the “zero” values were eliminated, thus assuming that
consumers always consumed foods that contained sulfites. This conservative
scenario simulates a situation of brand loyalty. In both scenarios, the potential
dietary exposure to sulfites was higher among adults than among children owing to
the consumption of wine.
In the first scenario, the potential dietary exposure to sulfites in adults did not
exceed the ADI at the mean but did at the 97.5th percentile (0.83 mg/kg bw per day).
The major contributor to mean dietary exposure in adults was wine, covering 20%
of the ADI. In children, dietary exposure was within the ADI (0.3 mg/kg bw per day)
at the 97.5th percentile.
In the second scenario, dietary exposure at the 97.5th percentile was higher
than in the first scenario and exceeded the ADI in adults (1.1 mg/kg bw per day)
and children (0.9 mg/kg bw per day). In the adults, wine was the main contributor
to mean and high dietary exposure (covering 20% of the ADI at the mean), followed
by dried fruits (covering about 5% of the ADI at the mean). Processed potatoes,
peeled potatoes and dried fruits were the main contributors to mean and high dietary
exposure in children (with each of these food groups covering about 10% of the ADI
at the mean).
In Lebanon, dietary exposures to sulfites were calculated by combining the
consumption data for selected foods in 230 children and adolescents with the mean
analytical residue levels in the food as consumed, after cooking (Soubra et al.,
2007). The mean dietary exposure to sulfites was within the ADI (63%), whereas it
was greater than the ADI (214%) at the 95th percentile. The major contributor was
nuts, covering 178% of the ADI in high consumers. Overall, dietary exposure was
greater than the ADI in 10% of subjects. The Committee noted that, owing to the
small size of the Lebanese sample, the high percentiles that were assessed bear
significant uncertainty and the true high percentile of dietary exposure could be
higher or lower.
4.

EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In its previous evaluation of sulfites in 2000, the Committee noted that the
use of sulfites at the MLs proposed in the draft Codex GSFA would lead to dietary
exposure in excess of the ADI. As a result, the MLs for sulfites are now lower in the
current version of the Codex GSFA. However, a number of national governments
have not yet reacted to the new MLs.
In the present evaluation, dietary exposure was assessed in a number of
Member States based on analytical determinations in products on the market and
in ready-to-consume products after cooking treatment. Sulfite residues were
sometimes found to be greater than the national MLs and the MLs of the current
Codex GSFA—in particular for non-alcoholic beverages and dried fruit.

SULFITES: ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY EXPOSURE

239

In all countries for which data were available, total dietary exposure to
sulfites in the general population was under the ADI at the mean but greater than
the ADI at high percentiles of exposure. In particular, dietary exposure was shown
to reach twice the ADI in children and teenagers in some countries. This was true
even when the concentration of sulfites in ready-to-consume foods was taken into
consideration. The Committee noted that some of the assessments of dietary
exposure were derived from 1-day food consumption survey data, which are known
to overestimate long-term consumption for rarely consumed foods. For this reason,
the Committee investigated whether the main contributors to dietary exposure were
foods and beverages that are commonly consumed.
The Committee noted that the main contributors to total dietary exposure
to sulfites differ in the different countries owing to differing patterns of consumption
of food to which sulfites may be added and to differing patterns of use of sulfites
in foods. Thus, dried fruit, sausages and non-alcoholic beverages were the
main contributors of sulfites in some countries, whereas these foods are generally
produced without the use of sulfites in other countries.
In children and teenagers, a significant contribution to mean exposure to
sulfites could come from fruit juices and soft drinks (including cordial), sausages,
various forms of processed potatoes, dried fruit and nuts.
In all countries where wine is regularly consumed, it was one of the main
contributors to exposure in adults. Sulfites are always present in wine, and the
average concentration determined analytically is usually around 100 mg/l,
significantly lower than the MLs in the current Codex GSFA. However, even at this
concentration, a regular consumption of 150 ml/day leads to a dietary exposure of
15 mg/day (0.25 mg/kg bw in a 60-kg adult), covering one third of the ADI. A regular
consumer of 450 ml would be exposed to the full ADI, under any of the current
national provisions and under Codex provisions. Other significant contributions to
dietary exposure in the adult population come from dried fruit, sausages and beer.
In some countries, the total dietary exposure per kilogram body weight is higher
in adults than in children, due to wine consumption. In other countries, dietary
exposure per kilogram body weight is higher in children and teenagers.
Countries that have not yet done so could consider collecting data on the
current use of sulfites in food and beverages available on their markets and
investigating whether dietary exposure in some subpopulations exceeds the ADI.
On the basis of this investigation, individual countries and the food industry could
consider the possibility of taking one or more of the following measures to reduce
dietary exposure to sulfites so that the ADI is not exceeded in the population: 1)
align national legislation with Codex MLs where these are lower; 2) take action to
effectively enforce national MLs; 3) encourage research on alternative methods of
preservation, particularly on applications in which the use of sulfites is responsible
for a significant contribution; and 4) take action so that the use of sulfites is reduced
in foods where safe alternative solutions are available.
Codex codes of practice for certain groups of food commodities, such as fruit
juice, dried fruit and processed meat, could include suggestions to help all countries
and the food industry in the implementation of a reduction of the use of sulfites in

240

food compatible with the safety of consumers (e.g. through use of alternative
technological solutions when available).

Note: All analysed foods were prepared to a “table-ready” state before analysis. Two means are given in the table: the “lower bound” derived by assuming
that not detected results and results between the LOD and the LOR are zero (trace = 0), and the “upper bound” derived by assuming that not detected
results are zero and results between the LOD and the LOR equal the LOR of 5 mg/kg (trace = LOR). Not detected results are less than the LOD of
2 mg/kg. The AOAC Modified Monier-Williams Method 962.16 was used for sulfite determination. The Food Standards Code does not permit the addition
of sulfites to minced meat. However, analytical data in minced meat indicate that illegal addition of sulfites to minced meat may occur. Of the 15 composite
samples of minced meat analysed in this study, sulfites were detected in 4 samples, with concentrations ranging from <5 to 105 mg/kg.

Note: Samples of minced meat were collected from 2000 to 2002 by environmental health officers. Analysis was carried out to determine the fat content,
sulfur dioxide and meat species using validated and UKAS-accredited test methods. Overall, 26 samples were found to contain sulfites, indicating an
illegal addition of sulfites: 25 were “lean beef minced meat”, and 1 was “minced pork, lamb/mutton and poultry meat”. Prior to 1977, the regulations in
force in Scotland allowed minced meat to contain up to 450 mg sulfites/kg during the months of June, July, August and September. The current
regulations do not permit the addition of sulfites to minced meat. However, owing to the original dispensation, the non-permitted addition of sulfur dioxide
to minced meat has continued to occur occasionally.

Source of analytical data for “minced meat”: Mackie (2005).

Note: Three categories of soft drinks were analysed: 1) concentrates based on fruit juice (squashes), 2) lemon and lime juice and 3) concentrates based
on fruit juice containing not less than 2.5% barley (barley waters). Samples were collected between 2003 and 2004 from five regions in the United
Kingdom. The levels of sulfites in all the tested samples were within the statutory limits: 350 mg/kg for lime and lemon juice and barley waters and 250
mg/kg for other concentrates based on fruit juice. The samples were analysed through an in-house United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)
accredited method (TM195) based on the modified Monier-Williams method.

Positive analytical determination suggests that an illegal use of sulfites occurred.

SAFETY EVALUATIONS OF GROUPS OF RELATED
FLAVOURING AGENTS

INTRODUCTION
Eight groups of flavouring agents were evaluated using the Procedure for
the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents as outlined in Figure 1 (Annex 1,
references 116, 122, 131, 137, 143, 149, 154, 160, 166, 173 and 178). In applying
the Procedure, the chemical is first assigned to a structural class as identified by
the Committee at its forty-sixth meeting (Annex 1, reference 122). The structural
classes are as follows:

• Class I. Flavouring agents that have simple chemical structures and efficient
modes of metabolism that would suggest a low order of toxicity by the oral route.

• Class II. Flavouring agents that have structural features that are less innocuous
•

than those of substances in class I but are not suggestive of toxicity. Substances
in this class may contain reactive functional groups.
Class III. Flavouring agents that have structural features that permit no strong
initial presumption of safety or may even suggest significant toxicity.

A key element of the Procedure involves determining whether a flavouring
agent and the product(s) of its metabolism are innocuous and/or endogenous
substances. For the purpose of the evaluations, the Committee used the following
definitions, adapted from the report of its forty-sixth meeting:

• Innocuous metabolic products are defined as products that are known or readily
•

predicted to be harmless to humans at the estimated intake of the flavouring
agent.
Endogenous substances are intermediary metabolites normally present in
human tissues and fluids, whether free or conjugated; hormones and other
substances with biochemical or physiological regulatory functions are not
included. The estimated intake of a flavouring agent that is, or is metabolized to,
an endogenous substance should be judged not to give rise to perturbations
outside the physiological range.

Estimates of the intake of flavouring agents by populations typically involve
the acquisition of data on the amounts used in food. These data were derived from
surveys in Europe, Japan and the United States of America (USA). In Europe, a
survey was conducted in 1995 by the International Organization of the Flavor
Industry, in which flavour manufacturers reported the total amount of each flavouring
agent incorporated into food sold in the European Union (EU) during the previous
year.
Manufacturers were requested to exclude use of flavouring agents in
pharmaceutical, tobacco or cosmetic products.
In the USA, a series of surveys were conducted between 1970 and 1987 by
the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (under contract
to the Food and Drug Administration) in which information was obtained from
ingredient manufacturers and food processors on the amount of each substance
destined for addition to the food supply and on the usual and maximal levels at which
each substance was added in a number of broad food categories.

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

265

In using the data from these surveys to estimate intakes of flavouring agents,
it was previously assumed that only 60% of the total amount used is reported in the
USA and 80% of the amount used is reported in Europe and that the total amount
used in food is consumed by only 10% of the population. At the present meeting, a
correction factor of 0.8 was applied to the annual production volumes reported in
the recent surveys from Europe, Japan and the USA.
9

Intake (μg/person per day) =

annual volume of production (kg) × 10 (μg/kg)
population of consumers × 0.6 (or 0.8) × 365 days

The population of consumers was assumed to be 32 × 106 in Europe, 13 ×
106 in Japan and 28 × 106 in the USA.

DIETARY EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT OF FLAVOURING AGENTS

INTRODUCTION

The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) employs
the maximized survey-derived intake (MSDI) method as a measure of the dietary
exposure to flavouring agents for use in the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of
Flavouring Agents (the Procedure). The MSDI provides a per capita estimate of the
dietary exposure to a flavouring agent that is compared with the relevant threshold
of toxicological concern (TTC) for each structural class in a decision tree approach
according to the Procedure. The TTCs for flavouring agents of class I, class II and
class III are, respectively, 1800, 540 and 90 μg/day. The MSDI is based on the
reported amount of the flavouring agent introduced into the food supply per year in
specific regions, currently Europe, the USA and Japan, corrected for possible underreporting, and assuming that 10% of the relevant population would consume the
foods containing the flavouring agent.
The Committee considered issues related to the dietary exposure to
flavouring agents at its forty-fourth, forty-sixth, forty-ninth, fifty-fifth, sixty-third, sixtyfifth, sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth meetings (Annex 1, references 116, 122, 131,
149, 173, 178, 184 and 187). The main concern expressed by the Committee was
that the MSDI may significantly underestimate the dietary exposure to some
flavouring agents. This could be the case for flavouring agents consumed by less
than 10% of the population, especially where they might be used in a few food
categories, and for flavouring agents with an uneven distribution of dietary exposure
among consumers. The uneven distribution might be due to a combination of
factors, including different use levels across and within food categories, restriction
to use in a few foods or food categories and different levels of consumption for
different foods. Exposure estimates for many flavouring agents calculated based on
reported use levels have been shown to be considerably higher than the
corresponding MSDI values, indicating the need for additional exposure estimates
based on use levels.
The single portion exposure technique (SPET) was developed at the sixtyseventh meeting of the Committee (Annex 1, reference 184) to account for
presumed consumer patterns of behaviour with respect to food consumption and
the possible uneven distribution of dietary exposure for consumers of foods
containing flavouring agents. The SPET provides an estimate of the dietary
exposure for an individual who consumes a specific food product containing the
flavouring agent every day. The SPET combines an average (or usual) added use
level with a standard portion size for a food category. Among all the food categories
with a reported use level, the dietary exposure from the single food category leading
to the highest dietary exposure from one portion is taken as the SPET estimate. The
standard portion does not reflect high food consumption amounts reported in
national dietary surveys.
At its sixty-eighth meeting and its present meeting, the Committee performed
a number of SPET and MSDI calculations with the aim of:

• determining if a set of criteria could be identified for future selection of flavouring
agents for which the MSDI could underestimate dietary exposure. In these cases,
extra information on added use levels recommended by the industry would be
required to calculate a SPET estimate;

• evaluating the possible impact of using both the MSDI and SPET dietary
exposure estimates in the Procedure for different flavour groups.

INVESTIGATION TO DEVELOP CRITERIA FOR THE IDENTIFICATION
OF FLAVOURING AGENTS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL
CONSIDERATION

2.1

Analysis of data for 57 flavouring agents considered at the
sixty-eighth meeting

At its sixty-eighth meeting, the Committee calculated SPET estimates for 57
flavouring agents based on use levels provided by the International Organization of
the Flavour Industry (IOFI),1 44 with low production volumes (<10 kg/year) and 13
with intermediate to high production volumes (production volumes corresponding
to an amount that was greater than a third of the relevant TTC). These flavouring
agents were selected from all structural classes and eight different groups. For 4 of
the 57 flavouring agents selected, the MSDI was greater than the corresponding
SPET estimate. Although for the remaining 53 flavouring agents the SPET estimate
was greater than the corresponding MSDI, different steps through the Procedure
would have been required in only two cases where the SPET estimate exceeded
the relevant TTC. The Committee concluded that, using this small group of flavours
for the analysis, it was not possible to develop any selection criteria (based on
production volume, structural class or flavour group) to identify cases where the
MSDI would have underestimated dietary exposure and different steps through
the Procedure would have been required if the SPET estimate were to be used in
the Procedure. Consequently, for the present meeting of the Committee, additional
data on use levels for another set of flavouring agents with intermediate to high
volumes of production were requested from IOFI to extend the analysis.
2.2

Analysis of data for 40 flavouring agents considered at the
current meeting

IOFI data were made available to calculate SPET estimates for 40 flavouring
agents from 15 different flavour groups with intermediate to high production
volumes. Of these, 28 were in class I, 6 in class II and 6 in class III. For class I
flavouring agents, none of the SPET estimates exceeded the TTC, whereas the
MSDI exceeded the TTC in one case. For class II flavouring agents, one SPET
estimate exceeded the TTC, whereas no MSDI estimates exceeded the TTC. For
class III flavouring agents, all six SPET estimates exceeded the TTC, whereas two
of the MSDI estimates exceeded the TTC. Cases where the SPET estimate
exceeded the TTC whereas the MSDI did not exceed it occurred in this group of
flavouring agents across different production volumes, structural classes and

IOFI collated data on added use levels from the European Flavour and Fragrance
Association (EFFA), the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) and the
Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association (JFFMA) and submitted these data on
behalf of the three organizations.

flavour groups, a similar finding to that for the 57 flavouring agents considered at
the sixty-eighth meeting.
2.3

Analysis of a larger data set of flavouring agents

Because the analyses of flavouring agents considered at the sixty-eighth
meeting and the present meeting were inconclusive, the Committee collected use
level data from other sources to determine if suitable criteria for predicting when the
MSDI might underestimate dietary exposure could be developed based on a larger
group of flavouring agents. Additionally, an analysis was carried out to determine
the difference between the SPET estimates and MSDI in relation to the relevant
TTCs. Overall, SPET estimates for 549 flavouring agents were calculated, based
on use levels derived from three main data sets:

• for 225 flavouring agents: recent and refined1 use level data provided by IOFI to
•
•

the Committee or to the European Commission (Directorate General for Health
and Consumer Affairs [DG SANCO]) in 2007 and 2008;
for 198 flavouring agents: refined1 use level data collected in an industry survey
(National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council [NAS/NRC])
conducted in the USA in 19772;
for 268 flavouring agents: use levels proposed by industry for flavouring agents
registered as Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) Generally
Recognized as Safe (GRAS)3 and published between 1965 and 2007.

Some flavouring agents were assessed using more than one source of use
levels, resulting in a total of 691 SPET estimates.
2.3.1 IOFI use level data, 2007–2008
MSDI and SPET estimates were compared for 225 flavouring agents with
updated and refined use level data from IOFI; for 128 flavouring agents, data had
been provided to DG SANCO (International Organization of the Flavour Industry/
Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs, 2008), for 40 flavouring
agents, data were provided to the present meeting of the Committee (International
Organization of the Flavour Industry/Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food
Additives, 2008), and for 57 flavouring agents, data were provided to the sixty-eighth
meeting of the Committee (International Organization of the Flavour Industry/Joint
FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, 2007) (see Figures 1a, 1b and

In this context, “refined” means that the information is derived from typical use levels in
specific foods or food types, rather than broad food categories (e.g. “fruit-flavoured yogurt”
as opposed to “dairy products”).

The use level data from this survey are those used in the paper by Young et al. (2006).

GRAS is a regulatory concept specific to the United States Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act. Any substance added to food requires a food additive regulation for its use,
unless its intended use is GRAS. Food ingredients whose use is GRAS are not required by
law to receive Food and Drug Administration approval before marketing. FEMA has been
publishing lists of flavouring substances, and associated use levels at or below which they
have deemed their use to be GRAS, for over 30 years.

1c). Among the 70 flavouring agents in class I, 2 exceeded the TTC using the MSDI
and 1 exceeded the TTC using the SPET estimate. Among the 12 flavouring agents
in class II, none exceeded the TTC using the MSDI and 1 exceeded the TTC using
the SPET estimate. Among the 143 flavouring agents in class III, 12 exceeded the
TTC using the MSDI and 86 exceeded the TTC using the SPET estimate. Overall,
in all classes, 14 flavouring agents exceeded the relevant TTC when the MSDI was
used and 88 exceeded the TTC when the SPET estimate was used. No suitable
selection criteria could be identified, because production volumes, structural
classes and food group were not related to whether or not a SPET estimate would
exceed the MSDI and/or the TTC.
2.3.2 Use level data from an industry survey conducted in the USA in 1977
MSDI and SPET estimates were compared for 198 flavouring agents with
refined use level data collected in an industry survey conducted in the USA in 1977
(National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, 1979) (see Figures 2a,
2b and 2c). Among the 121 flavouring agents in class I, 5 exceeded the TTC using
the MSDI and 38 exceeded the TTC using the SPET estimate. Among the 58
flavouring agents in class II, 4 exceeded the TTC using the MSDI and 13 exceeded
the TTC using the SPET estimate. Among the 19 flavouring agents in class III, 1
exceeded the TTC using the MSDI and 12 exceeded the TTC using the SPET
estimate. Overall, in all combined classes, 10 flavouring agents exceeded the
relevant TTC when the MSDI was used and 63 flavouring agents exceeded the
relevant TTC when the SPET estimate was used. Again, there were no relationships
between production volumes, structural classes or food groups and whether or not
the SPET estimates exceeded the MSDI and/or the TTC. No selection criteria could
be identified.
2.3.3 FEMA GRAS use level data, 1965–2007
MSDI and SPET estimates were compared for 268 flavouring agents using
FEMA GRAS use levels of broad food categories (see Figures 3a, 3b and 3c).
Among these, 60 were flavouring agents of structural class III, listed in the paper by
Munro & Danielewska-Nikiel (2006), 89 were submitted to the Committee at its sixtyfifth meeting and 145 were submitted to the Committee at the present meeting.
Among the 111 flavouring agents in class I, 1 exceeded the TTC using the MSDI
and 25 exceeded the TTC using the SPET estimate. Among the 62 flavouring
agents in class II, 1 exceeded the TTC using the MSDI and 32 exceeded the TTC
using the SPET estimate. Among the 95 flavouring agents in class III, 12 exceeded
the TTC using the MSDI and 77 exceeded the TTC using the SPET estimate. In
conclusion, in all classes combined, 14 flavouring agents exceeded the relevant
TTC when the MSDI was used and 134 exceeded the relevant TTC when the SPET
estimate was used. As with the other analyses, selection criteria could not be
identified.

2.3.4 Conclusion of the analysis
When all data were combined, it appeared that in nearly all cases (92%), the
SPET estimate was above the MSDI, and it was more likely that the SPET estimate
would be above the TTC of the relevant structural class than would the
corresponding MSDI. The SPET estimate was most frequently above the TTC in
class III, but this also occurred in classes I and II (see Table 1).

Note: Some flavouring agents were assessed using more than one source of use levels.

The Committee considered the use of FEMA GRAS use levels to be less
desirable than that of the more specific use levels provided by IOFI, as FEMA GRAS
values are projected and probably overestimate actual added use levels. IOFI
provided high-quality use level data from recent surveys and informed the
Committee that, with very few exceptions, there is a strong agreement between
recent and older use level surveys. IOFI also stated that the added use levels for
flavouring agents with similar flavouring effect are generally similar and have not
changed significantly over time.
From the analysis of the MSDI and SPET estimates for the 549 flavouring
agents, the Committee concluded that it was not possible to develop criteria, based
on production volume, structural class or flavour group, to predict when the MSDI
might underestimate dietary exposure and when the SPET estimate, but not the
MSDI, was likely to exceed the TTC.

Comparison of the magnitude of MSDI and SPET estimates

The Committee investigated the magnitude of the difference between the
corresponding SPET and MSDI estimates. The Committee considered that it would
be inappropriate to use the SPET estimates based on NAS/NRC data from 1977 or
FEMA GRAS levels for this purpose. Therefore, only the 225 flavouring agents with
IOFI use level data were used for this investigation. Overall, about 50% had a SPET
estimate that was less than 2 orders of magnitude higher than the MSDI (median
ratio of SPET to MSDI was 85). Twenty-one flavouring agents had an MSDI higher
than the SPET estimate by up to 2 orders of magnitude. For the remaining 204
flavouring agents, the SPET estimate was higher than the MSDI (median ratio of
SPET to MSDI was 149). Of these, 109 had SPET estimates that were 2 orders of
magnitude higher than the MSDI, and 24 had SPET estimates that were 4–6 orders
of magnitude higher than the MSDI (see Figure 4).

CONSIDERATION OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE SPET ESTIMATE
INTO THE PROCEDURE

At its present meeting, the Committee considered the consequences of
incorporating the SPET estimate into the Procedure, using two flavour groups as

DIETARY EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT OF FLAVOURING AGENTS

277

an example. One group was evaluated on the A-side of the Procedure (six hydroxyand alkoxy-substituted benzyl derivatives) and one group on the B-side (14
miscellaneous nitrogen-containing substances). For four flavouring agents, IOFI
use level data were available. For the other 16 flavouring agents, FEMA GRAS
levels were used to calculate the SPET estimate for the purposes of this exercise
only, because these were the only use levels available.
For these two groups of flavouring agents, the food categories responsible
for the highest dietary exposure in one standard portion were beverages, either
alcoholic or non-alcoholic (for nine flavouring agents), processed fruit (two cases),
processed vegetables (one case), meat products (two cases), cereals and cereal
products such as baked goods (four cases), condiments (one case) and milk and
dairy-based drinks (one case).
3.1

Hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted benzyl derivatives

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents
using the MSDI (Annex 1, reference 190) to the six flavouring agents in the hydroxyand alkoxy-substituted benzyl derivatives group of flavouring agents, the Committee
assigned five flavouring agents (Nos 1878–1880, 1882 and 1883) to structural class
I and the remaining flavouring agent (No. 1881) to structural class III. The evaluation
of all agents in this group proceeded via the A-side of the Procedure. According to
the Procedure using the MSDI, the safety of these six flavouring agents raised no
concern, because the dietary exposure was below the relevant TTC.
Incorporation of the SPET estimate into the Procedure would have resulted
in different steps through the Procedure for three of the six flavouring agents. SPET
estimates based on IOFI use levels were available for only one of the flavouring
agents in this group (No. 1882). Using the SPET estimate based on GRAS use
levels, the estimated dietary exposures to sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate
(No. 1880) and 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetic acid (No. 1883) exceeded the TTC
for structural class I (1800 μg/day). Similarly, the dietary exposure to divanillin
(No. 1881) exceeded the TTC for structural class III (90 μg/day).
3.2

Miscellaneous nitrogen-containing substances

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents
using the MSDI (Annex 1, reference 190) to the 14 flavouring agents in the group
of miscellaneous nitrogen-containing substances, the Committee assigned 12 (Nos
1884–1890, 1892–1894, 1896 and 1897) to structural class II and the remaining
2 (Nos 1891 and 1895) to structural class III. None of the flavouring agents in this
group could be predicted to be metabolized to innocuous products. The evaluation
of these 14 flavouring agents therefore proceeded via the B-side of the Procedure.
According to the Procedure using the MSDI, the safety of these 14 flavouring agents
raised no concern.
Incorporation of the SPET estimate into the Procedure would have resulted
in different steps through the Procedure for 2 of the 14 flavouring agents (Nos 1894
and 1895), as they would not have progressed to step B4. SPET estimates based

278

DIETARY EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT OF FLAVOURING AGENTS

on IOFI use levels were available for only three flavouring agents in this group (Nos
1889, 1893 and 1894).
3.3

Conclusion

The results for these two flavour groups indicated that the incorporation of
the SPET estimate into the Procedure for flavouring agents going through the
A-side of the Procedure will more often require appropriate toxicity data on the
flavouring agents or on closely related substances to complete the safety evaluation
at step A5. For flavouring agents going through the B-side of the Procedure,
additional toxicological data will more often be required for those flavouring agents
that do not progress to step B4. In all these cases, additional data would need to be
included in the submission for the flavouring agents. IOFI use level data would need
to be submitted in the data package for all flavouring agents going through either
side of the Procedure to enable SPET estimates to be made.
4.

UPDATED PORTION SIZES

Additional portion sizes have been defined for use at the present and
subsequent meetings, because use level data were reported for food categories
that had not been considered by the Committee at its sixty-seventh or sixty-eighth
meetings when the portion sizes for use in SPET estimations were defined. The
portion sizes are based in large part on regulatory United States standard portion
sizes, available at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2001/aprqtr/21cfr101.12.htm.
Moreover, at the present meeting, some portion sizes previously defined were
modified with the aim of harmonization of portion sizes among food categories that
have similar patterns of use. When use levels were reported for foods in powdered
form that must be reconstituted or prepared with water, portion sizes were calculated
based on different dilution factors, according to the type of products and instructions
reported on the product label:

• 1/25 for powder used to prepare water-based drinks such as coffee, containing
no additional ingredients;

• 1/10 for powder used to prepare water-based drinks containing additional
ingredients such as sugars (iced tea, squashes, etc.);

• 1/7 for powder used to prepare milk, soups and puddings;
• 1/3 for condensed milk.
The updated list of portion sizes is reported in Appendix 1.
5.

COMBINED DIETARY EXPOSURE

The SPET estimate for a flavouring agent represents the dietary exposure
for a daily consumer of a standard portion of food containing the substance. The
combination of SPET estimates for related flavouring agents could greatly
overestimate dietary exposure. The Committee therefore considered that the
estimate of combined dietary exposure in the Procedure should continue to be
based on the MSDI estimates, as outlined in the report of the sixty-eighth meeting.

CONCLUSION

The Committee noted that MSDI and SPET dietary exposure estimates
provide different and complementary information. Use of the SPET estimate
addresses previous concerns expressed by the Committee about the dietary
exposure methodology used in the Procedure, because the SPET estimates take
account of the possible uneven distribution of dietary exposures to a flavouring
agent for consumers of foods containing that substance. The higher value of the
two dietary exposure estimates (MSDI or SPET) should be used within the
Procedure.
As it was not possible to elaborate criteria to identify the flavouring agents
for which the MSDI underestimated dietary exposure and SPET estimates should
be used, the Committee concluded that it was necessary to incorporate SPET
estimates into the Procedure for all flavouring agents considered at future meetings
of the Committee. The Committee agreed that it would not be necessary to reevaluate flavouring agents that have already been assessed using the Procedure.
To enable a safety evaluation using the Procedure to be undertaken, the
Committee requested that added use level data be provided for each flavouring
agent in a timely fashion prior to the meeting, in addition to up-to-date production
volume data, as part of the data package for the safety evaluation. The Committee
will not perform a safety evaluation in the absence of such data.

The contribution from formula to the dietary exposure of infants should be considered separately. The consumption of formula was reported to be
about 90% of the total energy intake at 3 months of age in France (Boggio et al., 1999). After that age, this proportion of total energy intake from infant
formula decreases rapidly; therefore, it was considered appropriate to derive the highest average daily consumption of infant formula from the
consumption of infants of 3 months of age.
The median body weight for boys at 3 months is 6.4 kg (World Health Organization, 2006), and the consumption of formula can be calculated based
on 125 kcal/kg bw per day and on a content of 0.8 kcal/g in formula. This results in a consumption of formula of 1000 g/day (detailed calculation:

The Committee evaluated a group of flavouring agents consisting of
20 aliphatic branched-chain saturated and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids
and related esters. This group included 2 alcohols (Nos 1830 and 1832),
2 aldehydes (Nos 1817 and 1819), 2 acids (Nos 1818 and 1825) and 14 related
esters (Nos 1815, 1816, 1820–1824, 1826–1829, 1831, 1833 and 1834). The evaluations were conducted according to the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of
- 291 -

292

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

Flavouring Agents (see Figure 1, Introduction) (Annex 1, reference 131). None of
these flavouring agents has previously been evaluated by the Committee.
The Committee previously evaluated 32 other members of this group of
flavouring agents at its sixty-first meeting (Annex 1, reference 166). All 32 flavouring
agents in that group were concluded to be of no safety concern at the current estimated levels of intake, and the Committee maintained the previously established
group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–0.5 mg/kg body weight (bw), expressed
as citral, for citral (No. 1225), citronellol (No. 1219), geranyl acetate (No. 58), linalool
(No. 356) and linalyl acetate (No. 359). Citral and citronellol had already been evaluated by the Committee at its eleventh meeting (Annex 1, reference 14), at which
conditional ADIs1 of 0–0.25 mg/kg bw and 0–1 mg/kg bw, respectively, were allocated. At the twenty-third meeting of the Committee (Annex 1, reference 50), citronellol
and citral were re-evaluated as part of a group of terpenoid flavouring agents,
including geranyl acetate, linalool and linalyl acetate. A group ADI of 0–0.5 mg/kg
bw, expressed as citral, was established for citral, geranyl acetate, citronellol,
linalool and linalyl acetate on the basis of their clearly defined metabolism, rapid
excretion and low toxicity in short-term studies. The Committee maintained,
however, that a long-term study was required for at least one member of this group.
At its forty-ninth meeting (Annex 1, reference 131), the Committee evaluated
a group of 26 geranyl, neryl, citronellyl and rhodinyl esters derived from branchedchain terpenoid alcohols and aliphatic acyclic carboxylic acids by the Procedure.
Two-year studies of carcinogenicity had been conducted for a mixture of two of
these esters, geranyl acetate and citronellyl acetate. The Committee concluded that
there were no safety concerns for any of the 26 substances at the low levels of intake
arising from their use as flavouring agents and maintained the group ADI for citral,
geranyl acetate, citronellol, linalool and linalyl acetate. Likewise, at its fifty-fifth
meeting (Annex 1, reference 137), when the Committee re-evaluated linalool and
linalyl acetate as part of a group of 23 aliphatic acyclic and alicyclic terpenoid tertiary
alcohols and structurally related substances by the Procedure, the group ADI was
maintained. The findings from all previous evaluations were considered in the
present evaluation.
Twelve of the 20 flavouring agents in this group have been reported to occur
naturally in foods (Nos 1815, 1818, 1820, 1822, 1824–1827, 1830–1832 and 1834).
They have been detected in bread, animal fat, a variety of fruits, cinnamon, citrus
peel oils, peppermint oil, cheddar cheese, black tea, coffee, white wine, carrot,
honey and kelp, for example (Nijssen et al., 2007).
1.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The total annual volume of production of the 20 flavouring agents in this
group is approximately 270 kg in Europe (European Flavour and Fragrance
Association, 2005), 2200 kg in the USA (Gavin et al., 2007) and 40 kg in Japan
(Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association, 2002). In Europe, the USA as
well as Japan, prenyl acetate (No. 1827) makes the biggest contribution to the
total annual production volume (67%, 59% and 58%, respectively). The estimated
1

“Conditional ADI”, which signifies an ADI with special considerations, is a term no longer
used by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

293

daily per capita intake is the highest for prenyl acetate in the USA (160 μg). For the
other flavouring agents, the estimated daily per capita intakes were in the range of
0.01–68 μg. The estimated daily per capita intake of each agent is reported in
Table 1. Annual volumes of production of this group of flavouring agents are
summarized in Table 2.
1.3

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination

Information on the hydrolysis, absorption, distribution, metabolism and
elimination of flavouring agents belonging to the group of aliphatic branchedchain saturated and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters
has previously been described in the report of the sixty-first meeting (Annex 1,
reference 166). Additional data on the compounds methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate
(No. 1834) and (E,Z)-phytol (No. 1832) have now been submitted and are in line
with the information described in the report of the sixty-first meeting.
1.4

Application of the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring
Agents

Step A1.

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents to
the 20 flavouring agents in this group of aliphatic branched-chain saturated
and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters, the
Committee assigned 19 of these flavouring agents (Nos 1815–1833) to
structural class I and the remaining flavouring agent (No. 1834) to structural
class II (Cramer et al., 1978).

Step A2.

All flavouring agents in this group are expected to be metabolized to
innocuous products. The evaluation of all flavouring agents in this group
therefore proceeded via the A-side of the Procedure.

Step A3.

The estimated daily per capita intakes of all 19 flavouring agents in structural
class I are below the threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per day for
class I). According to the Procedure, the safety of these 19 flavouring agents
raises no concern when they are used at their current estimated levels of
intake.
The estimated daily per capita intake of the flavouring agent in structural
class II (i.e. methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate, No. 1834; synonym methyl
methacrylate) is below the threshold of concern (i.e. 540 μg/person per day
for class II). However, the Committee noted that there is a structural similarity
between this flavouring agent and ethyl methacrylate, a substance reported
to be neurotoxic. These two chemicals share a common metabolite,
methacrylic acid, which is unlikely to be a neurotoxicant because it is more
polar and therefore less likely to cross the blood–brain barrier. Because
methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate was shown to have some neurotoxic
properties in rats dosed at 500 mg/kg bw per day by gavage for 21 days, the
Committee decided to apply the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) for
structural class III (i.e. 90 μg/person per day), which was derived using data
that included neurotoxic compounds. Given that the estimated daily per
capita intake of methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate is even well below this lower
threshold of concern, the Committee concluded that the safety of this
flavouring agent raises no concern when it is used at its current estimated
level of intake.

Table 1 summarizes the evaluations of the 20 aliphatic branched-chain
saturated and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters
(Nos 1815–1834) in this group.
1.5

Consideration of combined intakes from use as flavouring agents

The flavouring agents in this group of aliphatic branched-chain saturated and
unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters are predicted to be
metabolized by hydrolysis and/or oxidative metabolism, followed by complete
metabolism in the fatty acid pathway or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These pathways
have a high capacity and would not be saturated, even if all flavouring agents were
consumed at the same time. Most of the substances in this group that have been
evaluated by the Committee at its present meeting and at the sixty-first meeting are
predicted or known to be metabolized to common metabolites. Common metabolites are 3-methylcrotonic acid (No. 1204), 2-methylbutyric acid (No. 255),
2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (No. 1205), (E,Z)-geranic acid (No. 1825), 3,7-dimethyl6-octenoic acid (No. 1221), phytanic acid, isobutyric acid (No. 253), methacrylic
acid, 2-methyl-2-pentenoic acid (No. 1210), (E,Z)-4-methylpent-2-enoic acid
(No. 1818), 4-ethyloctanoic acid (No. 1218) and 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,6,10trienoic acid. All of these substances are structural class I, except for methacrylic
acid, which is structural class II. All calculated combined intakes1 for each common
metabolite in Europe, the USA and Japan for up to five flavouring agents with the
highest intakes (i.e. Nos 1200, 1202, 1204, 1816 and 1827 for 3-methylcrotonic acid;
Nos 255, 1199, 1816 and 1820 for 2-methylbutyric acid; Nos 1201, 1205, 1822,
1823 and 1824 for 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid; Nos 1223, 1224, 1225, 1821 and 1822
for (E,Z)-geranic acid; Nos 1219, 1220, 1221 and 1823 for 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenoic
acid; Nos 1832 and 1833 for phytanic acid; Nos 253, 1206, 1213 and 1828 for
isobutyric acid; Nos 1207 and 1834 for methacrylic acid; Nos 1209, 1210 and 1815
for 2-methyl-2-pentenoic acid; Nos 1208 and 1818 for (E,Z)-4-methylpent-2-enoic
acid; Nos 1218 and 1819 for 4-ethyloctanoic acid; and Nos 1228, 1230 and 1831
for 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,6,10-trienoic acid) were below the threshold of
concern (i.e. 1800 and 540 μg/person per day for class I and class II, respectively),
except for (E,Z)-geranic acid.
For (E,Z)-geranic acid, the estimated combined intakes in the unlikely event
that the five flavouring agents with the highest intakes (Nos 1223, 1224, 1225, 1821
and 1822) were to be consumed concurrently on a daily basis were 8585 μg, 8303 μg
and 0.75 μg in Europe, the USA and Japan, respectively. However, these five
agents are all expected to be metabolized efficiently. Moreover, approximately 90%
of the estimated combined intake for (E,Z)-geranic acid is accounted for by citral
(No. 1225) alone, in both Europe and the USA.
The Committee at its sixty-first meeting concluded that, although high, the
estimated intakes for citral in Europe and the USA did not exceed the group ADI of
0–0.5 mg/kg bw, expressed as citral, for citral, geranyl acetate, citronellol, linalool
and linalyl acetate, nor did the total estimated combined intakes for all 32 flavouring
1

Combined intake was calculated on a molar basis relative to the formation of the common
metabolite.

306

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

agents under evaluation (Annex I, reference 166). The Committee at its present
meeting concluded that under the conditions of use as flavouring agents, the
combined intakes of the substances leading to a common metabolite would not
saturate the metabolic pathways and the combined intakes would not raise safety
concerns.
1.6

Consideration of secondary components

One member of this group of flavouring agents, (±)(E,Z)-5(2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl)-3-methyl-2-pentenal (No. 1817), has an assay value of
less than 95%. Information on the safety of the secondary component of this
compound is summarized in Annex 5 (Summary of the safety evaluation of
secondary components for flavouring agents with minimum assay values of less
than 95%). The secondary component in No. 1817, citral (No. 1225), was evaluated
by the Committee at its sixty-first meeting (Annex 1, reference 166) and was
considered not to present a safety concern at current estimated levels of intake.
1.7

Conclusion

In the previous evaluation of substances in this group, studies of acute
toxicity, short-term studies of toxicity (12 days to 28 weeks), long-term studies of
toxicity and carcinogenicity, and studies of genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity
were available. None raised safety concerns. The toxicity data available for this
evaluation supported those from the previous evaluation.
The Committee concluded that these 20 flavouring agents, which are
additions to the group of aliphatic branched-chain saturated and unsaturated
alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters evaluated previously, would not give
rise to safety concerns at the current estimated levels of intake.
2.

RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1

Explanation

This monograph summarizes key aspects relevant to the safety evaluation
of 20 aliphatic branched-chain saturated and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes,
acids and related esters, which are additions to a group of 32 flavouring agents
evaluated previously by the Committee at its sixty-first meeting (Annex 1,
reference 166).
2.2

Additional considerations on intake

Production volumes and intake values for each flavouring agent are reported
in Table 2.
Twelve of the 20 flavouring agents in the group have been reported to
occur naturally in traditional foods (Nijssen et al., 2007; Table 2). Quantitative data
on natural occurrence have been calculated for three of them (as described by
Stofberg & Grundschober [1987], based on quantitative data reported in Nijssen

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

307

et al. [2007]). The consumption of (E,Z)-geranic acid (No. 1825) is derived
predominantly from its presence in traditional foods (i.e. it has a consumption
ratio 1; Table 2), whereas the consumption of prenyl acetate (No. 1827) and
(E,Z)-3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,6,10-trienyl acetate (No. 1831) is derived predominantly from their use as flavouring agents (i.e. they have consumption ratios
<1; Table 2).
2.3

Biological data

2.3.1 Biochemical data
(a)

Hydrolysis, absorption, distribution and excretion

The Committee previously reviewed data on the hydrolysis, absorption,
distribution and excretion of flavouring agents belonging to the group of aliphatic
branched-chain saturated and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related
esters (Annex 1, reference 167). It was concluded that the esters in this group can
be expected to be hydrolysed by esterases to the corresponding alcohols and
carboxylic acids. Once formed, the latter substances, together with the other
alcohols, acids and aldehydes in this group, would be readily absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, the substances would be distributed rapidly
throughout the body, metabolized and excreted as polar metabolites in the urine,
faeces and expired air. Accumulation in the body is not to be expected.
Additional data are available on two substances in the present group of
flavouring agents: (E,Z)-phytol (No. 1832) and methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate
(No. 1834; synonym methyl methacrylate).
(i) (E,Z)-Phytol (No. 1832)
Two control rats and one rat fed 5% phytol in the diet for 14 days were given
0.1 mg of uniformly labelled [14C]phytol via gavage. The control rats were sacrificed
after 24 h, the test rat after 18 h. The two control rats absorbed 29% and 66% of
the amount of radioactivity, whereas the phytol-fed rat absorbed 65%. Expiration of
the radiolabel as 14CO2 was 35% and 40% in the control rats and 31% in the test
rat. Radiolabel in the total liver lipids was 2.1% and 2.6% for the controls and 9.7%
for the test rat. Phytanic acid was present in the liver (3% of the dose) of the test rat
and to a much lesser extent in the liver of one of the control rats (0.4% of the dose)
(Steinberg et al., 1965).
Four thoracic lymph duct–cannulated rats were administered tracer doses
of uniformly labelled [14C]phytol via gavage. Total recovery of the radiolabel from
the lymph, tissues, carbon dioxide, urine, intestinal contents and faeces ranged from
85% to 100%. Absorption within 24 h (taken as the radiolabel recovered in lymph,
tissues and carbon dioxide but excluding the small amount in urine, which was
collected together with the faeces) varied from 40% to 59% (Steinberg et al., 1965).

308

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

(ii) Methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834)
In male Wistar rats administered a single dose of methyl 2-methyl2-propenoate at 8 mmol/kg bw via gavage, serum concentrations of methacrylic
acid reached 0.5 mmol/l within 5 min after administration and peaked at about
0.8 mmol/l between 10 and 15 min after administration. In vitro studies
with rat and human serum confirmed the rapid hydrolysis of methyl 2-methyl2-propenoate to methacrylic acid. The hydrolysis was catalysed by non-specific
carboxylesterases, and steady-state kinetic parameters indicated that hydrolysis
was more efficient in rat serum than in human serum (Bereznowski, 1995).
In a series of experiments, the retention and excretion of methyl 2-methyl2-propenoate in rats were studied. Adult male Wistar rats (three per group) were
administered methyl [1,3-14C]methacrylate at 5.7 mg/kg bw via gavage or via
intravenous injection. Two additional groups of male Wistar rats were administered
methyl [2-14C]methacrylate at a dose of 6.8 mg/kg bw via intravenous injection (three
rats) or 120 mg/kg bw via gavage (two rats). All groups of rats were housed in glass
metabolism cages, and their exhaled carbon dioxide, urine and faeces were
monitored for 10 days post-dosing. Regardless of the route of administration, the
dose or the place of the radiolabel, 76–88% of the radiolabel was eliminated as
exhaled 14CO2, approximately 65% of which within the first 2 h after administration.
Only minor amounts of radiolabel were eliminated in the urine (4.7–7.2%) and
faeces (1.7–3.0%) (Bratt & Hathway, 1977).
Albino rabbits housed in metabolism cages were orally administered methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate at 3.5 ml/kg bw (equivalent to approximately 3.3 g/kg bw).
In urine collected for 3 days following administration, conjugates of glucuronic acid
and organic sulfates were present (Deichmann & Thomas, 1943).
Blood samples from 10 individuals were incubated with 10 μg methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate at 37 °C for 90 min. Disappearance of methyl 2-methyl2-propenoate from human blood followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Half-lives
varied from 18 to 40 min (Corkill et al., 1976).
(b)

Metabolism

Upon hydrolysis, the 14 esters in this group produce short-chain acids
(C1–C6; saturated, branched and unbranched; and unsaturated, branched) and
alcohols (mostly C1–C8, but also one C12 and one C16; saturated, branched and
unbranched; and unsaturated, branched). The group further consists of branchedchain saturated and unsaturated alcohols (C12 and C16), aldehydes (C5) and acids
(C5 and C8). The Committee previously reviewed data on the metabolism of linear
and branched-chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic acyclic alcohols,
aldehydes, acids and related esters (Annex 1, references 132 and 138) and on
some related terpenoids (Annex 1, reference 167). General aspects of their
metabolism have been described (Annex 1, references 131, 137 and 166).
Additional data are available on two substances in the present group of flavouring
agents: (E,Z)-phytol (No. 1832) and methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834).

(i) (E,Z)-Phytol (No. 1832)
Rats (number not specified) were fed diets containing 1% or 5% phytol for
3 weeks (equivalent to 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw per day). After 3 weeks, phytanic
acid accounted for 2.3% of the total liver fatty acids and 2.1% of the plasma fatty
acids in rats fed 1% phytol; and for 21.4% of the total liver fatty acids and 27% of
the plasma fatty acids in rats fed 5% phytol. In a subsequent experiment, two rats
were fed 5% phytol in the diet for 7 days, at which time phytanic acid accounted for
4.9% of the liver fatty acids in one of them. Phytol was then removed from the diet
of the other rat. Nine days later, this rat was sacrificed, and phytanic acid levels
were only 1.4% of total liver fatty acids (Steinberg et al., 1965). The observation in
this study that phytol is converted in rats into phytanic acid was confirmed in studies
by Klenk & Kremer (1965), Baxter et al. (1967) and Muralidharan & Muralidharan
(1985).
A series of experiments were conducted in mice and rats fed phytol and
phytanic acid in the diet (Mize et al., 1969). After feeding weanling mice for 3 weeks
with 2% phytol in the diet, significant levels of phytanic acid were present in the liver
(14% of total fatty acids) and skeletal muscle (11% of total fatty acids), with the
highest concentration shown in the heart (24% of total fatty acids). All tissues
showed an increase in branched-chain fatty acids progressively over the period of
the experimental diet. When mice were fed 2% phytanic acid for 10 days, branchedchain fatty acids accounted for 25% of the total liver fatty acids. Compared with
controls, their total liver fatty acid content was 30% higher. Livers of rats and mice
sacrificed 2 min after intravenous injection with 14C-labelled phytanic acid revealed
the rapid conversion of phytanic acid to pristanic acid. Pristanic acid represented
up to 41.5% of the total radioactivity in the liver (up to 10% of the dose administered),
with the level of radioactivity dropping significantly over time, presumably as a result
of ȕ-oxidation. 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid was also present in the liver of rats
and mice injected with 14C-labelled phytanic acid. In another experiment, one pair
of weanling rats and one pair of weanling mice were fed a diet containing 2% phytol
for 2 days, followed by intravenous injection with uniformly labelled [14C]phytol. The
rats were sacrificed at 3 and 20 min post-injection, the mice after 2 and 10 min. More
than 40% of the dose was found in total liver lipids at 2 and 3 min, respectively.
Phytanic acid, pristanic acid and 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoic acid were identified in
the total fatty acids (Mize et al., 1969).
Female Wistar rats were maintained on a phytol-free diet or on a diet
providing 1% phytol for 1 month (equivalent to 500 mg/kg bw per day). A third group
of female Wistar rats was first maintained on a control diet (duration not specified)
and then for 28 days on the 1% phytol diet. The animals maintained on the phytol
diet excreted 185–274 μmol 3-methyladipate/g creatinine in the urine as compared
with 9–27 μmol/g creatinine excretion by controls. Phytanic acid was detected in the
plasma of rats receiving phytol but not in the controls (Krywawych et al., 1985).
Figure 1 presents the proposed metabolism of phytol. Phytol undergoes
oxidation to phytanic acid, and thereafter it is metabolized via Į- and ȕ-oxidation
and cleavage to shorter-chain acids. Another possibility is that phytanic acid

undergoes Ȧ- and then ȕ-oxidation and cleavage to ultimately form 3-methyladipate

(ii) Methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834)
Thin liver slices harvested from male Wistar rats were incubated for 30 or
60 min with methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate or fumarate, a constituent of the citric
acid cycle, both at 7 mmol/l. The rates of metabolic transformation, determined as
a decrease of substrate concentration, were comparable for both compounds (the
substrate concentrations decreased by 59% and 73%, respectively, after 30 min).
In addition, liver slices were preincubated with arsenite, a known inhibitor of the citric
acid cycle, at 1 mmol/l for 2 h and with malonate, another inhibitor of the citric acid
cycle, at 10 mmol/l for 1 h. Malonate exerted no inhibition on the metabolic
transformation of methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate, whereas arsenite inhibited the

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

311

metabolic transformation. It is not exactly clear how these inhibitors act in the
citric acid cycle, but, according to the authors, this indicates that methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate enters the citric acid cycle as pyruvate (Pantucek, 1969).
In an in vivo metabolism study involving methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate, the
percentage of 14CO2 was measured with respect to the amount of administered
radiolabelled methyl [14C]2-methyl-2-propenoate via intragastric and intravenous
routes. Irrespective of the route of administration, the major metabolite detected
was 14CO2. Other minor metabolites were identified as [14C]methylmalonate,
[14C]succinate and possibly [14C]ȕ-hydroxyisobutyrate and [14C]2-formylpropionate.
In addition, formation of 14C-labelled normal physiological metabolites may be
expected owing to anabolism from 14CO2 and from [14C]acetate via the citric acid
cycle (see Figure 2) (Bratt & Hathway, 1977). According to Pantucek (1969), methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate enters the citric acid cycle via the formation of pyruvate
rather than via the formation of succinyl coenzyme A (CoA). However, in both cases,
eventually methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate will be fully oxidized in the citric acid cycle.

Acute toxicity

Oral median lethal dose (LD50) values have been reported for 11 of the
20 substances in this group, 1 of them being tested in mice, rats, guinea-pigs and

312

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

dogs, 9 of them being tested in rats only and 1 of them being tested in mice only
(see Table 3). In dogs and guinea-pigs, the oral LD50 values were 4680 and
5897 mg/kg bw, respectively (Spealman et al., 1945). In mice, oral LD50 values
ranged from >4550 to 5251 mg/kg bw (Lawrence et al., 1974; Ward, 1976; Moreno,
1982). In rats, oral LD50 values ranged from >2000 to >10 000 mg/kg bw
(Deichmann, 1941; Deichmann & LeBlanc, 1943; Spealman et al., 1945; Shelanski,
1972; Moreno, 1976, 1977a, 1977b, 1978, 1980; Kajiura, 1977a; BASF, 1978;
Moore, 2000; Klein, 2003). These LD50 values indicate that the acute toxicity of orally
administered aliphatic branched-chain unsaturated and saturated alcohols,
aldehydes, acids and related esters is low.

Short-term and long-term studies of toxicity

Only for 1 of the 20 substances in this group have studies of short-term
and long-term toxicity been reported. The results of these studies with methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834) are summarized in Table 4 and described below.
No additional studies of short-term or long-term toxicity on any of the related
substances have become available since their previous evaluation (Annex 1,
reference 167).
Groups of 20 male Wistar rats were administered methyl 2-methyl2-propenoate via gavage (vehicle not indicated) at a dose of 0 or 8 mmol/kg bw
(equivalent to approximately 800 mg/kg bw) for 30 consecutive days (Bereznowski,
1995). Body weight, food intake and water consumption were measured daily. At
the end of the study, blood samples were taken for analysis in enzyme assays
(serum alanine aminotransferase activity and other unspecified enzymes) and in
assays to determine bilirubin and protein concentration. Tissues and organs were
weighed and prepared for light microscopy.
No effects were seen on food consumption, serum analyses, body weight,
organ to body weight ratios or enzyme levels. Upon histopathological examination,
no abnormalities or lesions appeared in the examined organs (liver, spleen, kidney,
lung, heart, intestine and brain) (Bereznowski, 1995). The no-observed-effect level
(NOEL) is 800 mg/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested. The Committee, however,
noted the limited reporting of this study and that the examinations performed were
limited when compared with the requirements in current test guidelines for shortterm studies of toxicity.
In a 2-year study of long-term toxicity (Borzelleca et al., 1964), methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate was added to the drinking-water of groups of 25 male and
25 female Wistar rats at concentrations of 0, 6, 60 or 2000 mg/l. After 4 months of
treatment, the low and medium concentrations were increased to 7 and 70 mg/l,
respectively. Based on the average water intake over the whole study and assuming
an average body weight of 400 g for males and 250 g for females throughout the
study, these concentrations in drinking-water correspond to calculated intakes of
approximately 0, 0.6, 6 and 160 mg/kg bw per day for male rats and 0, 0.9, 9 and

200 mg/kg bw per day for female rats, respectively. Food and treated drinking-water
were available ad libitum. Body weights were recorded weekly. Water and food
consumption were determined over a 3-day period at the end of weeks 1 and 4, on
a monthly basis during months 2–6 and every other month to the end of the study
after month 6. At 3-month intervals, blood samples and pooled urine samples were
taken from five rats per sex per dose for haematological examinations (haematocrit,
haemoglobin, total and differential white blood cell count) and urinalysis (protein and
reducing substances). At termination of the study, all surviving animals were
sacrificed. Organ weights of heart, spleen, kidney, liver and testes were recorded.
Samples from some 15 tissues and organs (including liver, kidney, spleen and brain)
were preserved, and histopathological examinations were performed on samples
taken from all rats except those in the lowest treatment group.
There was no difference in survival between treated and control animals.
Aside from a slight reduction in body weight in high-dose animals during the first
few weeks of treatment, no changes in body weight were observed. Food
consumption was not affected by treatment, but water consumption was statistically

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

315

significantly reduced throughout the study in the high-dose animals. Haematological
evaluations and urinalysis showed no treatment-related differences, and the only
statistically significant finding in organ weights was an increase in relative kidney
weight in females from the high-dose group. Histopathological examination showed
no treatment-related abnormalities or lesions (Borzelleca et al., 1964). The NOEL
was 160 mg/kg bw per day for male rats and 200 mg/kg bw per day for female rats,
the highest doses tested. The Committee noted, however, that the reporting was
limited and that the examinations performed were limited compared with current test
guidelines for long-term studies of toxicity.
The same authors conducted a 2-year study of long-term toxicity in dogs
(Borzelleca et al., 1964). Groups of two male and two female beagle dogs were
administered gelatin capsules with methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate dissolved in corn
oil via their diet, at a dietary equivalent of 0, 10, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (equivalent to
0, 0.25, 2.5 and 25 mg/kg bw per day). The highest concentration was increased
to 1200 mg/kg at 5 weeks, to 1400 mg/kg at 7 weeks and to 1500 mg/kg at 9 weeks
(equivalent to 30, 35 and 37.5 mg/kg bw per day, respectively). The same
examinations as in the 2-year rat study were performed, except that the histopathological examinations were performed on all groups of dogs.
No significant differences between treated and control animals were noted
in any of the parameters examined, with the exception of a statistically significantly
increased relative spleen weight in dogs (sex not specified) of the mid-dose group
(Borzelleca et al., 1964). The NOEL is 37.5 mg/kg bw per day, the highest dose
tested. The Committee noted, however, that compared with current test guidelines
for long-term studies of toxicity, the number of animals per group was low and the
reporting and examinations performed were limited.
In addition to the studies summarized in Table 4 and described above, some
special investigations with methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate have been reported.
In a study investigating the relationship between chemically induced
forestomach cell proliferation and carcinogenesis, male F344/N rats were given
methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate and the structurally related ethyl acrylate (No. 1351;
evaluated by the Committee at its sixty-third meeting; Annex 1, reference 173) by
gavage at a dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg bw per day, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks.
Histopathological examination of the forestomachs of these rats (8 per group for
methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate and 12 per group for ethyl acrylate) revealed an
increase in the incidence of forestomach mucosal cell proliferation and
hyperkeratosis for ethyl acrylate, a known forestomach carcinogen following chronic
gavage administration. In contrast, for methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate, which is not
a forestomach carcinogen following chronic inhalation administration, no such
findings were observed, suggesting that methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate would
also not be a forestomach carcinogen following chronic gavage administration
(Ghanayem et al., 1986).
In a study investigating the effects of methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate on
testosterone level and male genital tissues, Sprague-Dawley rats were administered methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate in their drinking-water at concentrations of 0%
(15 rats), 0.4% (15 rats), 0.8% (10 rats), 1.6% (10 rats) and 3.2% (10 rats) for 8

316

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

months (equivalent to 0, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 mg/kg bw per day, assuming a
water consumption of 10% of the body weight). No effects were seen on survival
rate, food and water consumption or body weight. Seven rats in the 3.2% exposure
group and one rat in the 0.8% group showed partial atrophy of the lining epithelium
of the seminal vesicles. The seminal vesicles of the remaining rats showed normal
histology, as did the testes, epididymis and vas deferens of all rats. Testosterone
levels varied considerably between groups, both before and after treatment, and
observed changes were not consistent (Fakhouri et al., 2008a, 2008b).
(i) Neurotoxicity
Methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834) has also been evaluated by the
European Chemicals Bureau within the framework of Council Regulation (EEC)
793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of “existing” substances (Hansen
et al., 2002) and by the European Food Safety Authority within the framework of
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1565/2000 relating to the implications for human
health of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs (European Food Safety
Authority, 2008). Both evaluations mention an effect of methyl 2-methyl2-propenoate on the nervous system in humans exposed occupationally (via
inhalation and dermal routes) and in some short-term, but not in long-term,
inhalation studies with rats. There are only two studies available for evaluation
investigating the neurotoxic potential of methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate after oral
administration. Both studies are summarized below.
In a 21-day oral study, two groups of 30 male Wistar rats were administered
either methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate at 500 mg/kg bw per day or the vehicle (olive
oil) alone, presumably via gavage. Behavioural tests (spontaneous locomotor
activity, conditional avoidance response and aggressive behaviour) were carried
out on the 1st and 2nd days after treatment on batches of six rats from both groups.
From a separate batch of six rats from each group, brains were removed after
sacrifice and dissected into seven regions, followed by analysis of biogenic amines
(noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine) in these regions. Three rats
treated with methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate died (cause of death not reported). Body
weight and brain weight did not differ between treated rats and controls. Treated
rats had a shaggy appearance, were sluggish and showed changes in gait and rear
leg function for a brief period of 10 min after each treatment. Locomotor activity and
learning ability were also impaired, whereas aggressive behaviour was increased.
These changes were accompanied by changes in regional brain biogenic amine
levels. The authors remarked in this study that “no effect on behaviour was noted
at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses (unpublished data)” (Husain et al., 1985).
In a follow-up study, two groups of 20 male Wistar rats were administered
by gavage either methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate at 500 mg/kg bw per day or the
vehicle (olive oil) alone for 21 consecutive days. Rats were monitored for body
weight gain (weekly), gross appearance and righting reflexes (daily) during the
course of the treatment. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, animals were
sacrificed and brains and segments of sciatic nerves were removed, followed by
determination of lipid content (total lipids, triglycerides, phospholipids and
cholesterol) in brain, brain myelin, sciatic nerve and sciatic nerve myelin. No deaths

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

317

were reported, but the majority of the methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate–treated rats
were lethargic. Gait defects and hindlimb weakness were seen for about 10 min
following treatment, after which the rats recovered their normal gait completely.
Total lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol and triglycerides remained unchanged in
whole brain of methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate–treated rats. Although total lipids
remained unchanged in sciatic nerve, the constituents were all affected in treated
rats: concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides were statistically significantly
increased (by 26% and 65%, respectively), whereas the concentration of
phospholipids was statistically significantly decreased (by 17%). Some alterations
were observed in brain myelin lipids (decreases in triglycerides and cholesterol
content, increase in phospholipids content), but these changes were not statistically
significant when compared with control values. In sciatic nerve myelin, cholesterol
content was statistically significantly increased (42%), whereas triglycerides content
was (not statistically significantly) decreased (17%) in treated rats. Myelin protein
was stated to remain unaltered upon treatment (data not shown). The authors
suggested that the alterations in lipid composition, particularly in the cholesterol and
phospholipids in sciatic nerve, may be related to the peripheral neurotoxicity of
methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (Husain et al., 1989).
The Committee noted that there is a structural similarity between methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate and ethyl methacrylate, a substance reported by the
European Food Safety Authority (2008) to be neurotoxic, based on morphological
alterations in sections of brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve of rats treated with 0,
0.1, 0.2 and 0.5% ethyl methacrylate in their drinking-water for 60 days (equivalent
to 0, 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg bw per day, assuming a daily water consumption of
5% of the body weight) (Abou-Donia et al., 2000). Methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate
and ethyl methacrylate share a common metabolite, methacrylic acid. Methacrylic
acid, however, is unlikely to be a neurotoxicant because it is more polar and
therefore considered less likely to cross the blood–brain barrier.
(c)

Genotoxicity

Only for 2 of the 20 substances in this group have studies of genotoxicity in
vitro (Nos 1830 and 1834) and in vivo (No. 1834) been reported. The results of these
studies are summarized in Table 5 and described below. The Committee noted that
for methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate, a number of studies not available for review were
evaluated earlier by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1994) and
by the European Food Safety Authority (2008). These studies have been included
in Table 5 as well.

ALIPHATIC BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED AND UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS

Bensink, 1984; National Toxicology Program, 1986; Zeiger et al., 1987; Zeiger,
1990; Schweikl et al., 1994; Kajiura, 1997b). Methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate in
(cytotoxic) concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mmol/l showed weak positive
results in a similar assay utilizing S. typhimurium strain TM677 in the presence, but
not in the absence, of metabolic activation (Poss et al., 1979; Haskell Laboratory,
1989) and was negative in a similar assay in concentrations up to 2000 μg/plate in
S. typhimurium strain YG7108pin3ERb5 (Emmert et al., 2006).
Assays in mammalian cell lines have been performed with methyl 2methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834) only. In several mouse lymphoma mutation assays
in L5178Y cells, methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate showed positive results in the
presence of metabolic activation (Rohm & Haas Co., 1985; Amtower et al., 1986;
National Toxicology Program, 1986; Myhr et al., 1990; Dearfield et al., 1991). In the
absence of metabolic activation, one assay revealed negative results (Rohm & Haas
Co., 1985), one revealed ambiguous results (National Toxicology Program, 1986)
and four revealed positive (or weakly positive) results (Moore et al., 1988; Doerr et
al., 1989; Myhr et al., 1990; Dearfield et al., 1991). The positive results were mainly
observed at cytotoxic concentrations.
In the HPRT assay using V79B Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells, methyl
2-methyl-2-propenoate at concentrations of 10 or 20 mmol/l showed a very weak
mutagenic response after direct exposure for 24 h. The authors indicated that testing
this flavouring agent was difficult owing to severe cytotoxicity at concentrations
above 20 mmol/l (Schweikl et al., 1998). Micronucleus assays with V79 Chinese
hamster lung fibroblasts (Schweikl et al., 2001) and mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells
(Doerr et al., 1989) showed very weak positive results at concentrations that were
cytotoxic. In a cell transformation assay with BHK21/C13 cells, methyl 2-methyl-2propenoate tested negative at concentrations of 1 × 10í6 to 1 × 10í2 mol/l (Anderson
et al., 1979).
Methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate was also tested using Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells for colony-forming efficiency in a DNA synthesis inhibition assay and in
two cytogenetic assays (i.e. chromosomal aberration and sister chromatid exchange) (Yang et al., 2003). Clonogenic survival showed a statistically significant
dose- and time-dependent decrease in colony counts when exposed for 2, 6, 12 and
24 h to concentrations ranging from 10í6 to 10í3 (v/v) (equivalent to approximately
1–1000 μg/ml): plating efficiency was reduced between 20% and 40% after 2 h and
between 40% and 90% after 6–24 h. Results of the DNA synthesis inhibition assay
showed that methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate exposure reduced the rate of
[methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation in a statistically significant, dose-dependent
manner. Chromosomal aberrations and the frequency of sister chromatid
exchanges were also increased (Yang et al., 2003).
Other experiments also showed induction of chromosomal aberrations in
CHO cells (Anderson et al., 1990) and mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells (Moore et
al., 1988; Doerr et al., 1989) and of sister chromatid exchanges in CHO cells
(Anderson et al., 1990) following treatment with methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate.
Sister chromatid exchange experiments conducted with human lymphocytes were
negative (Cannas et al., 1987).

(ii) In vivo
In an in vivo replicative DNA synthesis study, weanling B6C3F1 mice were
administered a single dose of methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834) at 0, 1000
or 2000 mg/kg bw via gavage. At 24, 39 and 48 h, hepatocytes were harvested and
examined. No DNA synthesis was noted at either dose level (Miyagawa et al., 1995).
Groups of six mice were orally administered methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate
(range 1.13–4.52 g/kg) as part of a micronucleus test. The highest dose, split into
four equal amounts, was administered to an additional group of five mice. Frequency
of reticulocytes, the number of erythrocytes observed and the number of
micronucleated erythrocytes were recorded. There were no differences from
controls (Hachitani et al., 1982).
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (1994) reported that
methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate induced chromosomal aberrations in rat bone
marrow cells (Fedyukovich & Egorova, 1991) but not micronuclei in mouse bone
marrow cells (Hachitani et al., 1981) after intraperitoneal injection. The European
Food Safety Authority (2008) reported negative results in a dominant lethal assay
in mice (ICI, 1976b) and a chromosomal aberration test in humans (Seiji et al.,
1994), both following inhalation exposure to methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate.
(iii) Conclusion
(±)-Dihydrofarnesol (No. 1830) was found to be not mutagenic in Ames
assays with S. typhimurium and E. coli, with and without metabolic activation. Also,
methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate (No. 1834) tested for the most part negative in Ames
assays with S. typhimurium, with and without metabolic activation. Methyl 2methyl-2-propenoate induced micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations and sister
chromatid exchanges in several mammalian cell lines, predominantly at doses with
cytotoxic effects. However, in in vivo studies, methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate did not
induce replicative DNA synthesis or micronuclei in mice after oral administration or
dominant lethal mutations in mice or chromosomal aberrations in humans after
inhalation. Following intraperitoneal injection, methyl 2-methyl-2-propenoate
induced chromosomal aberrations in rats but not micronuclei in mice. Considering
all available data, the Committee concluded that there is no convincing evidence
that members of this group of aliphatic branched-chain saturated and unsaturated
alcohols, aldehydes, acids and related esters exhibit significant genotoxic potential
in vivo.

The Committee evaluated a group of flavouring agents consisting of 22
aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals
and esters. This group included 1 2-alkenal (No. 1803), 2 2-alken-1-ols (Nos 1793
and 1794), 2 2-alkenoic acids (Nos 1804 and 1805), 14 related alkenoic esters
(Nos 1795–1799 and 1806–1814), 2 2-alkenal acetals (Nos 1800 and 1801) and
1 unsaturated methoxy compound (No. 1802) that is predicted to be metabolized
to an Į,ȕ-unsaturated alcohol. The evaluations were conducted according to
the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents (see Figure 1, Introduction) (Annex 1, reference 131). None of these agents has previously been
evaluated by the Committee.

ALIPHATIC LINEAR Į,ȕ-UNSATURATED ALDEHYDES

The Committee previously evaluated 37 other members of this group of
flavouring agents at its sixty-third meeting (Annex 1, reference 173). The findings
from these evaluations were considered in the present evaluation. All 37 flavouring
agents in that group were concluded to be of no safety concern at the current
estimated levels of intake.
Thirteen of the 22 flavouring agents in this group are natural components
of foods (Nos 1793–1795, 1803, 1805–1812 and 1814). They have been primarily
detected in a wide variety of fruits, such as apple, strawberry, grape, pear, pineapple, mango, guava, cranberry, plum, passion fruit and papaya, as well as in red
and white wine, fruit juices and fruit brandies. They have also been detected to a
lesser extent in a number of meats, fish, vegetables and teas (Nijssen et al., 2007).
1.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The total annual volume of production of the 22 flavouring agents in this
group is approximately 530 kg in Europe (European Flavour and Fragrance Association, 2005), 1500 kg in the USA (Gavin et al., 2007) and 680 kg in Japan (Japan
Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association, 2002). In the USA, approximately 75%
of the total annual production volume is accounted for solely by (E,Z)-methyl
2-nonenoate (No. 1813), whereas (E,Z)-methyl 2-hexenoate (No. 1809) has the
next greatest contribution (approximately 20%). In Europe, more than 90% of
the total annual production volume is accounted for by ethyl trans-2-hexenoate
(No. 1808), ethyl trans-2-butenoate (No. 1806), ethyl trans-2-octenoate (No. 1812),
(E,Z)-methyl 2-nonenoate (No. 1813) and ethyl trans-2-decenoate (No. 1814). In
Japan, trans-2-hexenal propylene glycol acetal (No. 1801), ethyl trans-2-butenoate
(No. 1806) and ethyl trans-2-decenoate (No. 1814) account for more than 90% of
the total annual production volume. The estimated daily per capita intake is the
highest for (E,Z)-methyl 2-nonenoate in the USA (142 μg). For the other flavouring
agents, the estimated daily per capita intakes were in the range of 0.01–104 μg.
The estimated daily per capita intakes of each agent are reported in Table 1. Annual
volumes of production of this group of flavouring agents are summarized in Table 2.

1.3

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination

Information on the hydrolysis, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of flavouring agents belonging to the group of aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated
aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals and esters has previously been
described in the report of the sixty-third meeting (Annex 1, reference 173). No relevant additional data have been reported since that meeting.
1.4

Application of the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring
Agents

Step A1.

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents to the
22 flavouring agents in this group of aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated aldehydes,
acids and related alcohols, acetals and esters, the Committee assigned all 22
(Nos 1793–1814) to structural class I (Cramer et al., 1978).

Step A2.

All flavouring agents in this group are expected to be metabolized to innocuous
products. The evaluation of all flavouring agents in this group therefore
proceeded via the A-side of the Procedure.

Step A3.

The estimated daily per capita intakes of all 22 flavouring agents in structural
class I are below the threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per day for
class I). According to the Procedure, the safety of these 22 flavouring agents
raises no concern when they are used at their current estimated levels of intake.

Table 1 summarizes the evaluations of the 22 aliphatic linear Į,ȕunsaturated aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals and esters (Nos 1793–
1814) in this group.
1.5

Consideration of combined intakes from use as flavouring agents

The flavouring agents in this group of aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated
aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals and esters are predicted to be
metabolized by hydrolysis and/or oxidative metabolism, followed by complete

ALIPHATIC LINEAR Į,ȕ-UNSATURATED ALDEHYDES

345

metabolism in the fatty acid pathway or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These pathways have a high capacity and would not be saturated, even if all flavouring
agents were consumed at the same time. Most of the substances in this group
that have been evaluated by the Committee at its present meeting and at the sixtythird meeting are predicted or known to be metabolized to common metabolites.
Common metabolites (and their precursors) are (E)-2-butenoic acid (No. 1371),
(E)-2-pentenoic acid (No. 1804), trans-2-hexenoic acid (No. 1361), (E)-2-heptenoic
acid (No. 1373), (E)-2-octenoic acid (No. 1805), (E)-2-nonenoic acid (No. 1380) and
(E)-2-decenoic acid (No. 1372), all of which are structural class I. When calculating
for each common metabolite the combined intakes1 in Europe, the USA and Japan
for up to five flavouring agents with the highest intakes (i.e. Nos 1371, 1806 and
1807 for (E)-2-butenoic acid; Nos 1364, 1793, 1795 and 1804 for (E)-2-pentenoic
acid; Nos 1353, 1354, 1355, 1361 and 1801 for trans-2-hexenoic acid; Nos 1360,
1373, 1798 and 1799 for (E)-2-heptenoic acid; Nos 1363, 1367, 1370, 1811 and
1812 for (E)-2-octenoic acid; Nos 1362, 1365, 1369, 1380 and 1813 for (E)-2nonenoic acid; and Nos 1348, 1349, 1372, 1794 and 1814 for (E)-2-decenoic acid),
they were all below the threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per day for
class I). An additional consideration is that these common metabolites are part of a
homologous series of 2-alkenoic acids; the combined intakes of the five flavouring
agents in this homologous series with the highest intakes in Europe, the USA and
Japan (i.e. Nos 1353, 1354, 1355, 1801 and 1813) would not exceed the human
intake threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per day for class I). The Committee
concluded that under the conditions of use as flavouring agents, the combined
intakes of the substances leading to a common metabolite would not saturate the
metabolic pathways and the combined intakes would not raise safety concerns.
1.6

Consideration of secondary components

Three members of this group of flavouring agents, trans-2-hexenal glyceryl
acetal (No. 1800), hexyl trans-2-hexenoate (No. 1810) and methyl trans-2octenoate (No. 1811), have assay values of less than 95%. Information on the
safety of the secondary components of these three compounds is summarized in
Annex 5 (Summary of the safety evaluation of secondary components for flavouring
agents with minimum assay values of less than 95%). The secondary components
of trans-2-hexenal glyceryl acetal, 3-hexenal glyceryl acetal and hexanal glyceryl
acetal, are expected to share the same metabolic fate. The secondary component
of hexyl trans-2-hexenoate, hexyl trans-3-hexenoate, is expected to share the same
metabolic fate as the primary substance, as is the secondary component of methyl
trans-2-octenoate, methyl trans-3-octenoate. None of the secondary components
is considered to present a safety concern at current estimated levels of intake of the
flavouring agents.
1.7

Conclusion

In the previous evaluation of substances in this group, studies of acute
toxicity, short-term studies of toxicity (2–13 weeks), long-term studies of toxicity and
1

Combined intake was calculated on a molar basis relative to the formation of the common
metabolite.

ALIPHATIC LINEAR Į,ȕ-UNSATURATED ALDEHYDES

346

carcinogenicity and studies of genotoxicity were available. None raised safety
concerns. The toxicity data available for this evaluation supported those from the
previous evaluation.
The Committee concluded that these 22 flavouring agents, which are
additions to the group of aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated aldehydes, acids and
related alcohols, acetals and esters evaluated previously, would not give rise to
safety concerns at the current estimated levels of intake.
2.

RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1

Explanation

This monograph summarizes key aspects relevant to the safety evaluation
of 22 aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals
and esters, which are additions to a group of 37 flavouring agents evaluated
previously by the Committee at its sixty-third meeting (Annex 1, reference 173).
2.2

Additional considerations on intake

Production volumes and intake values for each flavouring agent are reported
in Table 2.
Thirteen of the 22 flavouring agents in the group have been reported to
occur naturally in traditional foods (Nijssen et al., 2007; Table 2). Quantitative data
on natural occurrence have been reported or calculated for four of them (Stofberg
& Grundschober, 1987). The consumption of (E)-tetradec-2-enal (No. 1803), ethyl
trans-2-butenoate (No. 1806), ethyl trans-2-hexenoate (No. 1808) and ethyl
trans-2-octenoate (No. 1812) is derived predominately from their presence in
traditional foods (i.e. they have a consumption ratio 1; Table 2).
2.3

Biological data

2.3.1 Biochemical data
No relevant information additional to that available and described in the
reports of the sixty-third meeting (Annex 1, references 173 and 174) was available
on the hydrolysis, absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of flavouring
agents belonging to the group of aliphatic linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated aldehydes, acids
and related alcohols, acetals and esters.
2.3.2 Toxicological studies
(a)

Acute toxicity

Oral median lethal doses (LD50 values) in rats have been reported for 3 of
the 22 substances in this group. For ethyl trans-2-butenoate (No. 1806), the LD50
was 3000 mg/kg body weight (bw) (Smyth & Carpenter, 1944). For hexyl
2-butenoate (No. 1807) and (E,Z)-methyl 2-nonenoate (No. 1813), the LD50 was

ALIPHATIC LINEAR Į,ȕ-UNSATURATED ALDEHYDES

347

>5000 mg/kg bw (Moreno, 1975, 1978). These results support the findings in the
previous evaluation (Annex 1, reference 174) that the oral acute toxicity of aliphatic
linear Į,ȕ-unsaturated aldehydes, acids and related alcohols, acetals and esters is
low.
(b)

Short-term and long-term studies of toxicity

No studies of short-term or long-term toxicity have been reported for any of
the 22 substances in this group. Also, no additional studies of short-term or longterm toxicity on any of the related substances have become available since their
previous evaluation (Annex 1, reference 174). For 2-hexenal (No. 1353), though, a
new study investigating the relationship among toxicity, deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) binding and cell proliferation in rats following gavage administration was
reported.
In that study, groups of 15 male F344 rats received trans-2-hexenal in
corn oil by oral gavage at a single dose of 0, 50, 200 or 500 mg/kg bw. Five animals per group were killed 1, 2 or 4 days after dosing. Additional groups of five
male rats received trans-2-hexenal in corn oil by oral gavage at a dose of 0, 10, 30
or 100 mg/kg bw per day for 5 days or for 5 days per week for 4 weeks and were
killed 1 day after administration of the final dose. Observations included, among
others, microscopic examination of liver, forestomach and glandular stomach, DNA
adduct analysis in liver, forestomach and glandular stomach (by measuring the
formation of trans- and cis-isomers of 1-N2-propanodeoxyguanosine [Hex-PdG]
by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry) and cell proliferation analysis in forestomach and liver (using proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry) (Stout et al., 2008).
No histopathological effects were observed in the liver. At a single dose
level of 50 mg/kg bw, forestomach damage was minimal, whereas at a single dose
level of 200 or 500 mg/kg bw, clear evidence of necro-ulcerative lesions and
inflammation of the forestomach was observed in several animals, accompanied
by proliferative hyperplasia. At 200 and 500 mg/kg bw, inflammation of the glandular
stomach was also observed. Upon repeated exposure, histopathological effects
were limited to the forestomach, with hyperplasia being the predominant finding,
increasing in incidence and severity with dose and duration of treatment. Ulcerative lesions and inflammation of the forestomach were observed only in two
animals given 100 mg/kg bw for 1 week. In the forestomach, Hex-PdG was quantifiable only after a single dose of 200 mg/kg bw for 1 day or after exposure to
100 mg/kg bw for 1 or 4 weeks, in concentrations (0.02–0.04 fmol/μg DNA) approaching the limit of quantification. At the highest single dose level of 500 mg/kg
bw, Hex-PdG measurements were not possible owing to complete or nearcomplete loss of the forestomach mucosa. In the glandular stomach, no DNA
adducts were detected at any exposure scenario. Adducts were occasionally, but
not reproducibly, observed in liver DNA of rats exposed to single doses of 200 or
500 mg/kg bw and killed 1 day after dosing, in concentrations at or slightly below
the limit of quantification. Forestomach cell proliferation was significantly increased
after exposure to 30 mg/kg for 4 weeks or 100 mg/kg for 1 or 4 weeks. Liver cell

ALIPHATIC LINEAR Į,ȕ-UNSATURATED ALDEHYDES

348

proliferation was not significantly increased over controls in the liver after exposure
to 100 mg/kg bw for 1 or 4 weeks (Stout et al., 2008).
This study indicates that 2-hexenal (No. 1353) can induce DNA adduct
formation and cell proliferation upon gavage administration, but only at the site of
contact and at doses inducing forestomach toxicity. DNA adduct formation following
gavage administration of 2-hexenal was also described in the previous evaluation
(Annex 1, reference 174). Based on these data and data on other 2-alkenals, the
Committee at the previous meeting concluded that
high cellular concentrations of 2-alkenals may deplete glutathione, leading to
oxidative stress and the formation of protein and DNA adducts. Under these
conditions, alkenals may also form endogenously from the increased lipid
peroxidation of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids. To some extent, repair is
observed after cessation of exposure. At the concentrations of alkenals that are
present in the diet, there is no significant potential for oxidative stress or the
formation of DNA adducts.

In the absence of a study of long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity on 2hexenal, but clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in the forestomach of rats and
mice following gavage administration of the structurally similar Į,ȕ-unsaturated
aldehyde trans,trans-2,4-hexadienal (No. 1175), the Committee at the previous
meeting discussed the relevance of these findings for humans (Annex 1,
reference 174). It was concluded that
the appearance of forestomach lesions in the 2-year bioassays in rodents in which
trans,trans-2,4-hexadienal was administered at high concen-trations by gavage
has no relevance to humans, given that the results are attributable to the irritating
effect of high bolus doses of trans,trans-2,4-hexadienal delivered to the contact
site (forestomach) by gavage, and not the effects of systemic concentrations in
the whole animal. On bio-chemical grounds and in analogy to trans,trans-2,4hexadienal, trans-2-hexenal (No. 1353), therefore, would also be expected not to
have any carcinogenic potential in humans.

(c)

Genotoxicity

Only for 1 of the 22 substances in this group has a study of genotoxicity in
vitro been reported. For this substance, (E,Z)-methyl 2-nonenoate (No. 1813), there
was no evidence of mutagenicity in a standard and modified (preincubation method)
Ames assay when various strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA102,
TA1535 and TA1537) were incubated with up to 5000 μg/plate, with or without
metabolic activation (Poth, 2003).
One additional study of genotoxicity in vitro has been reported for two
substances evaluated previously. Negative results were obtained in an SOS
chromotest when Escherichia coli strain PQ 37 was incubated with 2-hexenal
(No. 1353) or 2-heptenal (No. 1360) at concentrations up to 69 and 90 μg/plate,

ALIPHATIC LINEAR Į,ȕ-UNSATURATED ALDEHYDES

respectively, using dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol as solvents (Eder & Deininger,
2002).

EXPLANATION

The common structural features of this group of six substances are an
allylbenzene nucleus and one or more alkoxy ring substituents. All have an alkoxy
substitution at the para position. Three members of the group contain a 3,4methylenedioxy substituent and may have additional methoxy substituents:
safrole (3,4-methylenedioxyallylbenzene, No. 1792), myristicin (5-methoxy-3,4methylenedioxyallylbenzene, No. 1791) and apiole (2,5-dimethoxy-3,4methylenedioxyallylbenzene, No. 1787) (Figure 1). Three other substances contain
only methoxy substituents: estragole (4-methoxyallylbenzene, No. 1789), methyl
eugenol (3,4-dimethoxyallylbenzene, No. 1790) and elemicin (3,4,5trimethoxyallylbenzene, No. 1788) (Figure 1). Because of the widespread
occurrence of alkoxy-substituted allybenzenes in food, mainly in spices and herbs
but also in certain vegetables and fruits, these substances are referred to by their
common names.
Estragole was reviewed by the Committee at its twenty-third and twenty-fifth
meetings (Annex 1, references 50 and 56), and safrole was reviewed at the fifth and
twenty-fifth meetings (Annex 1, references 5 and 56). For estragole, no acceptable
daily intake (ADI) was allocated at the twenty-fifth meeting, and the Committee
requested additional long-term studies for evaluation of carcinogenic potential. For
safrole, the Committee concluded at its twenty-fifth meeting that flavouring agents
containing safrole or isosafrole as the principal flavour-active ingredient should not
be used as food additives; and that it is not practicable to advocate the
discontinuance of spices containing safrole or isosafrole as minor constituents (e.g.
nutmeg, mace and cinnamon). However, the Committee at that meeting concluded
that when these spices were used, the amounts of safrole and isosafrole in the
finished product should be kept as low as practicable.
Only two of the substances, estragole and methyl eugenol, are used as
flavouring agents intentionally added to compounded flavours. This use is limited

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

353

to the USA, where annual volumes are low (491 kg/year for estragole and 77 kg/
year for methyl eugenol) (Gavin et al., 2007). Oral intake of these six substances in
Europe and Asia, as well as the USA, occurs both by consumption of foods, mainly
spices and herbs, in which they occur and by consumption of essential oils that are
physically isolated from these foods.
Many of these substances are genotoxic and carcinogenic in animals. In
accordance with general principles elaborated by the Committee at its forty-ninth
meeting (Annex 1, reference 131), the Committee at its present meeting concluded
that these substances could not be evaluated using the Procedure for the Safety
Evaluation of Flavouring Agents.
The relevant background information below summarizes the key scientific
data applicable to the safety assessment of the six methoxy- and methylenedioxysubstituted allylbenzenes.

Natural occurrence

To varying extents, members of the group are constituents of the plant
families Umbelliferae (anise, star anise, fennel, sweet fennel, parsley),
Myristicaceae (nutmeg and mace), Labiatae (sweet and exotic basil) and
Compositeae (tarragon). Although they are present in many other foods at low
levels, intake of the methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes (safrole, myristicin
and apiole) occurs from consumption of spices and herb and spice oils. Exposures
to myristicin and safrole occur mainly by consumption of nutmeg, mace, parsley,
parsley seed oil and star anise. Intake of apiole is predominantly from consumption
of parsley (Appendix 1). Intakes of the three methoxy-substituted allylbenzenes also
occur principally from consumption of spices and spice oils. Intake of estragole
occurs primarily from consumption of foods containing sweet basil, fennel and anise

354

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

or their essential oils (Smith et al., 2002); intake of methyl eugenol is from nutmeg,
allspice, sweet basil and fennel; and intake of elemicin is from nutmeg, mace,
tarragon and parsley seed oil (see Appendix 1).
1.2

Estimated daily per capita exposure to alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes

1.2.1 From spices, herbs and herb and spice oils
Although methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes such as
safrole, myristicin, methyl eugenol and estragole occur at low levels in oranges,
bananas and grapefruit juice (Nijssen et al., 2008), exposure from food occurs
predominantly from the use of spices, including basil, tarragon, nutmeg, mace and
allspice. Based on the oil content of a wide variety of spice samples obtained from
the global marketplace and the range of concentrations of individual alkoxysubstituted allylbenzene constituents in those oil samples, a low and high
concentration of each alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene in specific spices can be
estimated (see Appendix 1). Based on these lower and upper limit concentrations
and recent annual reported volumes of spice imports and exports (International
Trade Centre, 2006; Gavin et al., 2007; United States Department of Agriculture,
2007), the upper and lower limits and the mean daily per capita intake of each
alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene from spices and spice oils can be calculated
(Table 1). The most complete available data set originates from the USA. Data on
spice and herb imports from other regions, including the European Union (EU) and
the Pacific Rim, are limited. Nevertheless, a comparison of estimated intakes from
comprehensive data from the USA and limited EU data suggests that, in general,
intakes are roughly similar.
Although myristicin, safrole, estragole and methyl eugenol intakes arise from
different spice sources, all exhibit a similar range of intakes, which is approximately
400–600 μg/person per day, based on the upper limits of their concentrations in
spices and spice oils (Table 1). An important caveat that must be considered when
evaluating these estimations, however, is that the levels of methoxy- and
methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes in spices vary significantly depending
upon exact growing region, plant maturity at harvest, harvesting techniques, storage
conditions and processing methods (e.g. extraction, drying). Nonetheless, data on
a wide range of commercially available spices and oils can be used to determine
an aggregate average daily intake for these substances.
The range of intake of methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes from spices and spice oils is generally similar, with the mean intake of
safrole, myristicin, estragole and methyl eugenol in the range of 63–166 μg/person
per day. Based on the highest reported levels of spice oil in the spice and the highest
reported concentration of the methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted
allylbenzenes in the oil, the maximum dietary intake levels for the same four
substances are in the range of 424–569 μg/person per day in the USA. Based
primarily on EU import data for nutmeg and mace, the maximum dietary intake levels
for safrole and myristicin are 879 and 684 μg/person per day, respectively. The
maximum dietary intakes of the remaining two alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes

a
Intake (μg/person per day) calculated as follows: [(Total annual volume, kg) × (1 × 109 μg/
kg)]/[population × 365 days], where population = 320 × 106 for Europe and 280 × 106 for the
USA. The lower and upper limits and the mean values for per capita intake are based on
lower and upper limits and mean values for the percentage of volatile oil content in a spice
or herb product and the lower and upper limits and mean values for the percentage of
methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzene within the volatile oil.

(elemicin and apiole) from all sources make a minor contribution to overall intake.
A conservative estimate of the average daily intake of any one of the alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes is less than 1 mg/day. For the four alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes with the highest production volume, intakes from spice sources
normally exceed intakes from spice oil sources by at least a factor of 10.
The methyl eugenol content of the volatile oil from commercial samples of
sweet and exotic (i.e. Reunion-type, as found in the Comoro Islands) basil is 0–0.5%
and 1.3–2.0%, respectively (Lawrence & Shu, 1993). The contents in the leaf,
flower and stem for the same cultivar of sweet basil were in the range of 0.6–2.4%,
with the highest concentration found in the leaf (Tsai & Sheen, 1987; Sheen et al.,
1991). The methyl eugenol content of sweet basil leaves of the Genovese Gigante
variety is inversely proportional to plant height (maturity); the content in the essential
oil of sweet basil decreased from essentially 100% to 10% as the plant matured

356

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

from 3–6 cm to 12–16 cm (Miele et al., 2001). Accordingly, early-harvested basil
contains significantly higher levels of methyl eugenol. For basil harvested at the
optimum time and stored over various periods, the concentration of methyl eugenol
in fresh leaves was 0.05%, in leaves stored 2 months, 20.4%, and in leaves crushed
and frozen at 20 °C, 1.6% (Bobin et al., 1991). These are a few of the many factors
leading to the wide variation in lower- and upper-level intakes reported in Table 1.
In certain regions, these factors are used to produce spices with more desirable
flavouring properties, containing, in some cases, relatively high levels of methoxyand methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes.
In certain regions, there are specialized consumer groups that may be
exposed to higher levels of allylbenzene derivatives. Pesto eaters ingest some of
the highest levels of methyl eugenol, because fresh pesto is prepared from a large
quantity of fresh sweet basil. Considering that a single portion of pesto may contain
up to 10 g of basil (oil content 0.5%) and that the Genovese Gigante cultivar of basil,
the most commonly used basil in pesto preparation in north-western Italy, contains
>40% methyl eugenol, a typical serving of pesto may provide up to 250 μg/kg body
weight (bw) of methyl eugenol (Miele et al., 2001). This single consumption may
result in intakes 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than mean intakes of 80 μg/day
(Table 1). However, because pesto is not consumed daily even for these specialized
consumer groups, their average lifetime intake when calculated on a daily basis
would approach mean or maximum daily intake levels for non-specialized consumer
groups.
1.2.2 Used as flavouring agents
Only estragole and methyl eugenol are used as flavouring agents, and use
is limited to the USA. Based on annual production volumes of 491 kg/year for
estragole and 77 kg/year for methyl eugenol (Gavin et al., 2007), per capita intakes
for the whole population as flavouring agents for the USA are 5 and 0.8 μg/day,
respectively.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

Consistent results from pharmacokinetic and metabolic experiments for
methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes—safrole (No. 1792), myristicin (No. 1791)
and apiole (No. 1787)—and methoxy-substituted allylbenzenes—methyl eugenol
(No. 1790), estragole (No. 1789) and elemicin (No. 1788)—indicate that this group
of substances undergoes rapid and essentially complete absorption following oral
intake (Kamienski & Casida, 1970; Fritsch et al., 1975a, 1975b; Benedetti et al.,
1977; Sutton et al., 1985; Anthony et al., 1987; Lee et al., 1998). Based on studies
in rats and humans, these substances are highly bioavailable following the
consumption of spices containing these constituents (Beyer et al., 2006). A number
of shared biotransformation pathways exist for this group of substances, as
described in section 2.1.2.

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

357

2.1.1 Absorption, distribution and elimination
(a)

Rodents

Based on data in rodents, the pharmacokinetics of alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes are strongly dose dependent.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered oral doses of [1ƍ-14C]safrole
ranging from 0.63 to 750 mg/kg bw. Groups of three rats were sacrificed at intervals
up to 48 h, and plasma, liver and kidney tissues were collected. Plasma levels in
rats administered [1ƍ-14C]safrole at 4.2 mg/kg bw reached a maximum (2–3 μg/ml)
at 1–3 h, followed by a rapid decrease by 8 h. Unchanged [1ƍ-14C]safrole, which
accounted for a small fraction of the total radioactivity, reached a maximum at 1 h
and rapidly decreased to less than 2% (0.01 μg/ml) at 8 h. At 750 mg/kg bw, plasma
total radioactivity increased slightly up to 8 h and remained essentially constant up
to 24 h. At this dose level, unchanged safrole accounted for 50% of radioactivity up
to 24 h after dosing. Urinary elimination of total radioactivity was rapid at the lowest
dose of 0.63 mg/kg bw (88% at 24 h) compared with the elimination at 750 mg/kg
bw (25% at 24 h). These data correlated with total tissue radioactivity levels. At the
750 mg/kg bw dose, liver and kidney radioactivity levels remained high up to 48 h,
and the tissue to plasma radioactivity ratio and unchanged safrole levels were much
greater than recorded at the low dose of 4.2 mg/kg bw. Collection of bile from rats
given [1ƍ-14C]safrole at either 0.8 or 750 mg/kg bw showed that 20% of total
radioactivity was eliminated in the bile in 24 h at the low dose and only 3% at the
high dose (Benedetti et al., 1977).
Orally administered [14C-methylene]myristicin and [14C-methylene]safrole
have been studied in rats and mice (Casida et al., 1966; Kamienski & Casida, 1970;
Peele, 1976). Male Swiss-Webster mice were given radiolabelled safrole or
myristicin at 5 μmol/kg bw (approximately 0.60 mg/kg bw) by stomach tube, and
urine, faeces and carbon dioxide were collected at regular intervals over 48 h. Liver
and intestines were removed and analysed for radioactivity. After 48 h, 61% and
73% of the radioactivity were recovered from administered safrole and myristicin,
respectively, as expired carbon dioxide, presumably arising from Odemethylenation metabolism. In addition, 23% and 3% of the radiolabelled safrole
and 15% and 3% of the radiolabelled myristicin were recovered from the urine and
faeces, respectively. Less than 2.5% of the radioactivity was detected in the liver
for either safrole or myristicin (Kamienski & Casida, 1970).
Female rats given a 50 mg/kg bw oral dose of 14C-methoxy-labelled estragole
eliminated more than 71% in the first 24 h, with an additional 3.5% eliminated in the
following 24 h. Approximately 1% remained in the carcass at 48 h. Approximately
38% was eliminated in the urine, 31% in expired air and 1.3% in the faeces
(Zangouras, 1982). With oral administration to female Wistar rats of [14C]estragole
at doses of 0.05, 5, 50, 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw, the majorities of the low doses (0.05–
50 mg/kg bw) were eliminated as 14C-labelled carbon dioxide in expired air (average
of 55% on day 1 and 2.7% on day 2). Urinary elimination at these dose levels
accounted for, on average, 32.4% of the total radioactivity after 2 days. At the higher
dose levels (500 and 1000 mg/kg bw), elimination of radioactivity via expired air was

358

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

less (average of 29% on day 1 and 17% on day 2), and urinary elimination was
greater (average of 30% on day 1 and 29% on day 2), indicating a changeover in
metabolism and elimination (Anthony et al., 1987).
Rats dosed orally by gavage with methyl eugenol (Food Chemicals Codex
grade) at either 37 or 150 mg/kg bw showed peak plasma levels of 1.5 and 4 μg/ml,
respectively. Plasma half-lives for disappearance of methyl eugenol were 30–60
min, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were 97 and 225 μg/ml per minute at
37 and 150 mg/kg bw, respectively (Graves & Runyon, 1995).
Groups of F344/N rats (12 per sex per group) were administered methyl
eugenol at 37 mg/kg bw by intravenous injection or at 37, 75 or 150 mg/kg bw by
oral intubation. Blood collected at time points up to 360 min revealed a biphasic
plasma concentration–time profile, including an initial rapid distribution phase
followed by an elimination phase (National Toxicology Program, 2000). Maximum
plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 0.656–3.84 μg/ml for males and 1.14–8.25 μg/ml
for females were proportional to oral dose levels, whereas time to maximum plasma
levels (Tmax) was rapid (5 min) and independent of dose. The AUC increased linearly
with dose for both males and females. AUCs were in the range of 33.5–459 μg/ml
per minute for males and 27–307 μg/ml per minute for females. Per cent
bioavailability also increased with dose. Bioavailability of methyl eugenol after a
single oral dose administered by gavage was low (6% at 37 mg/kg bw, 13% at
75 mg/kg bw and 19% at 150 mg/kg bw). Disappearance half-lives were in the range
from 60 to 115 min for both sexes. In groups of B6C3F1 mice (24 per sex per group)
given 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg bw by gavage, peak plasma levels were similar to those
for rats (0.38–3.10 μg/ml for males and 0.12–4.4 μg/ml for females) and were
reached in 5 min (Tmax) in all groups except females in the 25 mg/kg bw group, which
showed a Tmax of 15 min. Plasma half-lives were shorter (30 min) and AUCs were
significantly lower than those recorded for rats (4.91–48.4 μg/ml per minute for
males and 3.27–60.5 μg/ml per minute for females), indicating that methyl eugenol
was eliminated more rapidly from the mouse. Seventy-two hours after intravenous
or oral administration of high doses (11.8 and 118 mg/kg bw, respectively) of [14C]methyl eugenol to male rats (three rats per group), radioactivity was concentrated
mainly in the liver (radioactivity 2- to 3-fold higher in liver than in blood) (National
Toxicology Program, 2000).
In another study at the same laboratory, blood was taken from F344/N rats
that were administered methyl eugenol at doses of 37, 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg bw by
gavage daily, 5 days per week, for 6, 12 or 18 months (National Toxicology Program,
2000). B6C3F1 mice treated at the same dose levels were monitored at 12 and 18
months. Absorption was extremely rapid in all dosed groups. Time to Cmax (Tmax) was
less than 5 min. Elimination from the blood was also rapid, with elimination half-lives
of 1–2 h in both sexes. After 6 months, peak plasma levels (Cmax) increased with
increasing dose. Female plasma concentrations (1.4–2.4 μg/ml) were higher than
those in males (0.5–0.4 μg/ml) at the two lowest doses, but male plasma
concentrations (1.3–4.0 μg/ml) were higher than those of females (0.8–3.1 μg/ml)
at the two highest doses. Generally, at the same dose levels, Cmax was lower after
6 months of repeated daily exposure than after single-dose administration. In male
rats, significant increases in both Cmax and AUC between 6 and 12 months in the

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

359

150 and 300 mg/kg bw groups, but not in the lower dose groups, suggest that
metabolic saturation is achieved during this time interval at higher dose levels. At
all dose levels, females displayed only small dose-dependent increases in AUCs
compared with naive animals, whereas males at 37, 75 and 150 mg/kg bw exhibited
more significant AUC increases relative to undosed animals, suggesting that
metabolic enzymatic induction plays a more important role in males. An increase in
AUCs with time suggests a decrease in the capacity to metabolize methyl eugenol
with age (National Toxicology Program, 2000). For mice administered 35, 75 or
150 mg/kg bw per day orally for 2 years, absorption was also rapid. Cmax was
reached after 5 min and increased with increasing dose for both males and females.
Elimination half-lives increased with dose, suggesting that the elimination was
saturated for both sexes.
More than 95% of a single 200 mg/kg bw dose of methyl eugenol and 56–
66% of a 100 mg/kg bw dose of estragole administered as a 1% suspension to male
rats by stomach tube were excreted in the urine within 24 h. When the same dose
levels were administered by intraperitoneal injection, >85% of the methyl eugenol
dose and 77–87% of the estragole dose were excreted in the urine after 24 h
(Solheim & Scheline, 1973).
Blood and urine were collected at regular intervals from male F344/N rats
given [ring-14C]methyl eugenol at 118 mg/kg bw orally by gavage. More than 72%
was eliminated in the urine, 13% in the faeces and <0.1% in expired air after 72 h.
Residual amounts (<0.4%) remained in the tissues at 72 h, with the majority being
present in the liver. In female mice given the same dose, 85% was eliminated in the
urine, 6% in the faeces, <0.1% in the expired air and <0.3% in the tissues. The
largest amount was found in the fat, followed by the muscle and liver (Burkey et al.,
1999).
(b)

Humans

Humans were administered oral doses of 0.163 or 1.66 mg of [1ƍ-14C]safrole,
and plasma samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. At the higher
dose, maximum plasma levels of radioactivity occurred at 30 min, with less than 2%
of the total radioactivity being unchanged safrole (2–3 ng/ml). Collection of urine
samples at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h revealed that more than 92% of
administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine within 24 h at either dose level.
Ninety-eight per cent of the dose was recovered in the urine and faeces after 5 days.
The kinetics of elimination of the radioactivity were biphasic, with half-lives of 2.5
and 15 h (Benedetti et al., 1977).
A 100 μg dose of 14C-methoxy-labelled estragole in a gelatin capsule was
administered to two humans. More than 35% was eliminated in the urine after 8 h,
49.4% after 24 h and 61.2% after 48 h. More than 11% of the 14C was eliminated in
expired air after 8 h. Approximately 70% of the dose was recovered within 48 h
(Sangster et al., 1987).
A unique subset of the world population, located mainly in South-east Asia,
regularly chews betel quid, which is a combination of betel leaf (Piper betle) and
areca nut (Areca catechu). The most common commercial form is a dry preparation

360

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

called gutkha, which consists of betel leaf, tobacco, areca nut, catechu (extract of
the Acacia catechu tree) and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). Spices or sweeteners
are also added to increase palatability (National Cancer Institute, 2002; Nair et al.,
2004). Betel leaves are rich in a number of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes, and
daily quid chewing results in chronic exposure to these materials. Betel leaves are
rich in several chemical classes of potential carcinogens, including a number of
alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes. To assess the exposure to safrole and its potential
relationship to the occurrence of oral and liver cancer among a group of betel quid
chewers in Taiwan, China, the glucuronic acid conjugate of the O-demethylenation
metabolite (1,2-dihydroxy-4-allylbenzene) was evaluated as a biomarker for
exposure. Urine samples collected during the study were treated with ȕglucuronidase to deconjugate metabolites. To establish the validity of the method,
male Wistar rats were administered 0, 75, 150 or 300 mg safrole/kg bw in corn oil.
Urine samples collected 1 and 2 days post-administration showed a linear dose–
response relationship for the presence of the O-demethylenation metabolite
resulting from opening of the methylene ring. Analysis of the urine of seven betel
quid non-chewers showed that the concentration of the O-demethylenation
metabolite ranged from 0.75 to 17.75 μg/mg creatinine, with a median of 1.64 μg/
mg creatinine. Urine samples of four betel quid chewers contained 1.47–12.16 μg
O-demethylenation metabolite/mg creatinine, with a median of 4.17 μg/mg
creatinine, which was ~2.54 times the mean for non-chewers. The Odemethylenation metabolite was concluded to be an appropriate biomarker for
exposure to safrole through betel quid chewing (Chang & Ko, 2000).
In a non-representative subset of adult serum samples collected as part of
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA (NHANES
III, 1988–1994; National Center for Health Statistics, 1994), the mean serum methyl
eugenol concentration was approximately 24 pg/g serum (whole weight), with
concentrations ranging from <3.1 to 390 pg/g serum (whole weight) (Barr et al.,
2000).
The human elimination kinetics of methyl eugenol were also evaluated. A
commercial brand of gingersnaps was given to nine healthy adult male and female
volunteers. The volunteers were given 12 gingersnaps containing a total of 216 μg
methyl eugenol for breakfast. Blood was drawn immediately before the meal and at
15, 30, 60 and 120 min afterward. The fasting level of methyl eugenol in serum
(mean ± standard deviation [SD]) was 16.2 ± 4.0 pg/g wet weight. Peak blood levels
were found at 15 min (53.9 ± 7.3 pg/g wet weight), followed by a rapid decline to a
mean level of 25 pg/g serum (whole weight); the half-life of elimination was about
90 min. The peak levels were within the range of methyl eugenol blood levels in
the background population in the USA (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994).
The results of this study suggest that low levels of methyl eugenol are present in
the blood after an oral dose and that the levels rapidly decline. Because
measurements were not made on any elimination processes (e.g. urine and faecal
elimination), it is not known whether methyl eugenol was eliminated, stored (e.g. in
organs and tissues such as adipose tissue) or a combination of the two (Schecter
et al., 2004).

Summary

Based on the above data, it can be concluded that safrole, myristicin,
estragole, methyl eugenol and other alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes are rapidly
absorbed by the oral route. In humans given safrole, estragole or methyl eugenol,
rapid absorption, distribution and elimination occur, and elimination of the parent
substance and metabolite is essentially complete within 24 h. When chronically
exposed (>6 months) to high dose levels of methyl eugenol, male rats are more
prone than female rats to experience metabolic saturation. Male rats also
experience metabolic induction at lower dose levels and earlier in exposure than do
female rats. In both rodents and humans, routes of elimination at low doses include
loss as carbon dioxide via expired air (i.e. arising from O-dealkylation) and excretion
of polar metabolites in the urine. At higher doses, the fraction eliminated by expired
air decreases while the fraction of non-volatile urinary metabolites increases, which
supports the hypothesis that metabolic saturation is occurring at higher dose levels.
2.1.2 Biotransformation
The biotransformations of these substances are dose dependent and show
species and sex differences. At low doses in rodents and humans, aromatic ring
substituents (e.g. methoxy or methylenedioxy) are converted to phenolic derivatives
that can be excreted either unchanged or as conjugates. At similar doses, Odealkylation (O-demethylation or O-demethylenation) appears to be favoured more
in the mouse and human than in the rat. At higher dose levels, including those
commonly used in rodent toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, biotransformation of
these compounds involves greater oxidation of the allyl side-chain (i.e. 1ƍhydroxylation and alkene epoxidation).
Administration of safrole to rats at oral dose levels ranging from 0.9 to
600 mg/kg bw revealed a dose-dependent decrease in O-demethylenated
metabolites and an increase in allyl side-chain oxidation products; 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole
was formed in rats, but it was not detected in humans administered a dose of 1.66
mg safrole (Benedetti et al., 1977).
In a similar dose-dependent study with estragole, as the dose was increased
from 0.05 to 1000 mg/kg bw in mice and rats, the extent of O-demethylation
decreased while 1ƍ-hydroxylation increased about 10-fold from about 1% to 9% of
urinary radioactivity in both species (Zangouras et al., 1981).
The extent of 1ƍ-hydroxylation of estragole, which is the metabolic activation
pathway for this group of compounds (Phillips et al., 1981; Swanson et al., 1981;
Miller et al., 1983; Wiseman et al., 1985), was slightly higher in rats after oral dosing
than in mice after intraperitoneal administration and increased with increase in
dosage in both species (Anthony et al., 1987).
The sulfate conjugate of the 1ƍ-hydroxylation metabolite has been implicated
as the proximate carcinogenic metabolite for this type of substance (Wiseman et
al., 1987). Although epoxidation of the allyl double bond has been reported in vivo
(Luo & Guenthner, 1995, 1996), intoxication via the epoxidation of the allyl sidechain is not as significant as activation via the 1ƍ-hydroxylation pathway.

362

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

Three primary biotransformation processes operate on methoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes and methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes (see Figures 2 and 3):
1. O-Demethylenation (Figure 2) of safrole, myristicin and apiole yields the
diphenolic derivative, which is to a large extent excreted as the sulfate or
glucuronic acid conjugate (Benedetti et al., 1977; Lee et al., 1998; Beyer et al.,
2006). Similarly, O-demethylation (Figure 3) of the one or more methoxy
substituents of estragole, methyl eugenol or elemicin (see below) yields the
corresponding phenolic derivative, which may be excreted in conjugated
form (Zangouras et al., 1981; Sangster et al., 1983, 1987; Anthony et al., 1987;
Beyer et al., 2006). The O-dealkylation pathway is the major route of
metabolism at low doses in humans, mice and rats (Benedetti et al., 1977; Lee
et al., 1998). Dose-dependent metabolism studies on the structurally related
propenylalkoxybenzene derivative, 4-methoxypropenylbenzene (anethole),
confirm that O-demethylation is the predominant metabolic pathway at low dose
levels (<10 mg/kg bw) in the rat and the mouse (Sangster et al., 1987).
2. In an alternative pathway, epoxidation of the double bond in the allyl side-chain
yields the 2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide (Figures 2 and 3). The epoxide is rapidly detoxicated by
epoxide hydrolase to form the diol and more slowly detoxicated via glutathione
conjugation (Luo et al., 1992; Luo & Guenthner, 1995). The hydrolysis products
of the epoxide of myristicin, safrole or elemicin were detected as minor
metabolites in the urine of rats administered high doses (100 mg/kg bw) of each
substance individually or a high dose of nutmeg (500 mg/kg bw) (Beyer et al.,
2006). In in vitro experiments, the epoxide readily forms deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) adducts, but rapid detoxication in vivo by epoxide hydrolase and
glutathione S-transferase (GST) prevents it from forming detectable levels of
DNA adducts (Luo & Guenthner, 1996). The carboxylic acid formed via
oxidation of the diol may be conjugated with glycine and excreted or undergo
ȕ-oxidation, cleavage and conjugation to the corresponding hippuric acid
derivative (Luo & Guenthner, 1995).
3. The primary bioactivation pathway of methylenedioxy- (Figure 2) or methoxysubstituted allylbenzenes (Figure 3) is hydroxylation of the alkene side-chain to
yield the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite (Drinkwater et al., 1976; Benedetti et al., 1977;
Zangouras et al., 1981; Miller et al., 1983), which can be conjugated with either
glucuronic acid or sulfate or can undergo isomerization. The 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolite contains an unstable terminal alkene (i.e. 1ƍ-hydroxy-2,3-alkene). To
some extent, the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite or its sulfate conjugate can be
isomerized to yield the more stable 3ƍ-hydroxy-1ƍ,2ƍ-alkene containing a readily
oxidizable primary alcohol function. Oxidation of the primary alcohol produces
a cinnamic acid derivative, which can undergo ȕ-oxidation and cleavage to yield
a benzoic acid derivative. This metabolite can be excreted as the glycine
conjugate (Solheim & Scheline, 1976; Delaforge et al., 1980).
The sulfate conjugate of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite is currently considered to
be the proximate hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic agent in rodents (Smith et
al., 2002). The unstable sulfate ester is anticipated to hydrolyse to form a reactive
electrophilic intermediate (carbonium ion or quinonium cation), which binds to
proteins and DNA. The formation of protein and DNA adducts in liver is dose

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

363

dependent (Drinkwater et al., 1976; Swanson et al., 1981; Miller et al., 1982, 1983;
Boberg et al., 1983; Gardner et al., 1995, 1996; Daimon et al., 1998). Sulfate
inhibition studies and in vivo–in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays of
myristicin, elemicin, estragole, methyl eugenol and the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites of
estragole and methyl eugenol (Boberg et al., 1983; Caldwell et al., 1992; Chan &
Caldwell, 1992; Hasheminejad & Caldwell, 1994) provide additional evidence that
the sulfate ester of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite is the principal intoxication metabolite
in animals.
Additional biochemical studies have provided information on the influence of
dose and species on the formation of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite, the cytochrome
P450 (CYP) isoenzymes that catalyse the 1ƍ-hydroxylation pathway and the
formation of protein and DNA adducts with the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite.
The metabolism in animals of methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted
allylbenzenes is determined by dose. At low doses in vivo, CYP-catalysed oxidation
and cleavage of the O-methylene of the methylenedioxy substituent of myristicin,
apiole or safrole are by far the predominant pathway, yielding polar
dihydroxyallylbenzene metabolites that are readily excreted either free or as sulfate
or glucuronic acid conjugates. At high doses in rodents, O-demethylenation
becomes saturated, and 1ƍ-hydroxylation and epoxidation of the allyl side-chain
compete. This change in the balance of metabolic pathways from O-dealkylation to
1ƍ-hydroxylation with dose has been demonstrated better for methoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes, notably estragole (Anthony et al., 1987), than for methylenedioxysubstituted allylbenzenes (Smith et al., 2002). This shift may be due to the increased
oxidative cleavage of methylene from the methylenedioxy function. Since the 1ƍhydroxylation and the subsequent formation of the 1ƍ-sulfoxy metabolite have been
associated with the toxicity and carcinogenicity of these substances, the effect of
dose and, to a lesser extent, species significantly impacts the interpretation of the
results of toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.
In a three-part metabolism study (Beyer et al., 2006), groups of rats were
administered safrole, myristicin or elemicin, either individually or as constituents of
powdered nutmeg. Urinary metabolites were then compared with those of a human
consuming a relatively large dose of ground nutmeg. Male Wistar rats were
administered oral doses (100 mg/kg bw) of the nutmeg ingredients myristicin,
safrole or elemicin, and the urine was collected separately from faeces over the next
24 h. In a second phase of the study, rats were given an aqueous suspension of
ground nutmeg at 500 mg/kg bw from two different batches. In addition, urine
samples were collected from a nutmeg-abusing inpatient who reportedly consumed
large amounts of nutmeg powder. Urine samples of all dosed groups were treated
with glucuronidase and arylsulfatase, then acetylated and subjected to gas
chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis.
The 24-h urine of rats dosed with safrole or myristicin at 100 mg/kg bw
contained metabolites derived from O-demethylenation, epoxidation and hydrolysis
(as a 2,3-dihydroxy derivative) and 1ƍ-hydroxylation (see Figure 2), with the peak
area of the O-demethylenation metabolite being at least 10 times that of any other
metabolites. Rats treated with elemicin at 100 mg/kg bw primarily showed

When rats were dosed orally with ground nutmeg as an aqueous suspension
at 500 mg/kg bw (approximately 1–2 mg myristicin/kg bw, with lesser amounts of
safrole and elemicin), the O-demethylenation or O-demethylation, epoxidation, and

366

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

epoxidation and hydrolysis metabolites were detected in the urine. As expected,
3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxyallylbenzene, the product of O-demethylenation of
myristicin, was the major metabolite. However, no 1ƍ-hydroxylation metabolites
could be detected by this GC/electron impact MS method. The presence of the
1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites in rats given the pure substances at 100 mg/kg bw and
their absence in rats given nutmeg at 500 mg/kg bw may be due to higher dose
(100 versus 1–2 mg/kg bw) or to an effect of the rats being administered a nutmeg
matrix, which alters the metabolic fate of each of these alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes (Beyer et al., 2006).
In a human who reported ingesting the powder of about five nutmegs
(20–50 g of nutmeg, corresponding to 140–280 mg elemicin or 2.3–4.6 mg elemicin/
kg bw, 100–200 mg myristicin or 1.6–3.2 mg myristicin/kg bw, and approximately
20 mg safrole or 0.3 mg safrole/kg bw), analysis of the urine revealed that the major
metabolites of each of the three constituents were detected. As for rats given ground
nutmeg, no 1ƍ-hydroxylation metabolite was detected. For both rats and humans
exposed to nutmeg, the corresponding O-demethylenation metabolite of safrole or
myristicin was the predominant metabolite, exceeding other metabolites by at least
a factor of 10. The side-chain demethylation products were the major metabolites
of elemicin (Beyer et al., 2006).
Two humans were administered an oral dose of 1.66 mg of [1ƍ-14C]safrole,
and urine was collected for 24 h. The percentage of radioactivity extracted from
urine increased from 32% to 73% after treatment with glucuronidase, indicating that
a majority of urinary metabolites were glucuronic acid conjugates. Analysis of urine
metabolites by GC/MS indicated that the O-demethylenation product was the major
metabolite (65%). At the limits of detection (approximately 10 times less than the
measured level of O-demethylenation metabolite), no 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite could
be detected (Benedetti et al., 1977). In the same study, rats were administered
[1ƍ-14C]safrole at single oral doses of 0.90, 60 or 600 mg/kg bw, and urine was
collected over 48 h. Glucuronidase hydrolysis significantly increased the
percentage of radioactivity that was extracted, indicating that glucuronic acid
conjugates accounted for the majority of urinary metabolites. The major metabolite
was 1,2-dihydroxyallylbenzene, but its proportion decreased significantly when the
dose was increased from 60 to 600 mg/kg bw. At 600 mg/kg bw, 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole
was detected in the urine. The other metabolites identified were 3ƍ-hydroxyisosafrole
and 3(4)-hydroxy-4(3)-methoxyallylbenzene. Other studies using relatively high
dose levels of either safrole or myristicin via the oral or intraperitoneal route support
the observation that 1,2-dihydroxyallylbenzene is the major metabolite. The
detection of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite in rats correlates with the appearance of low
levels of protein and DNA adducts in rodents (see below).
Safrole was largely metabolized by O-demethylenation in male SwissWebster mice, Sprague-Dawley rats or hamsters. When each of these species was
1,2-dihydroxyallylbenzene
was
administered
[methylenedioxy-14C]safrole,
produced as the major metabolite, resulting from oxidative metabolism that
produces [14C]formate or [14C]carbon dioxide, which were both identified (Kamienski
& Casida, 1970).

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

367

At higher dose levels, the proportion of excreted 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole increases
(Borchert et al., 1973; Stillwell et al., 1974). Groups of rats received a single dose
of safrole at 300 mg/kg bw by intraperitoneal injection with and without bile duct
ligation or pretreatment with CYP inducers 3-methylcholanthrene or phenobarbital.
Without pretreatment, 1.6% and 1.1–1.3% of the dose were excreted in the urine
as either 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole or its conjugated metabolite by adult male and female
rats, respectively. A small amount of 3ƍ-hydroxyisosafrole was also detected in the
urine. Rats with bile duct ligation excreted 2.8% of 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole in the urine.
Adult and 4-week-old male rats showed significant increases (15–29%) in urinary
1ƍ-hydroxysafrole when pretreated with either 3-methylcholanthrene or
phenobarbital. When safrole as added to the diet of male rats at levels calculated
to provide an intake similar to that used in the intraperitoneal experiment, 5–10%
was excreted as 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole for the first 18 days, and an average of 3–4%
was excreted thereafter. With continuous administration of phenobarbital, the
urinary excretion of 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole averaged 7% of the safrole dietary level over
an 11-week period (Borchert et al., 1973). After administration of a single
intraperitoneal dose of safrole at 300 mg/kg bw to male guinea-pigs or hamsters,
the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine as 1ƍ-hyroxysafrole was 2.1–2.5%
and 3.5% without pretreatment, 2.7% and 0.9–1.0% after bile duct ligation, and
2.3–4.2% and 1.1% after phenobarbital treatment, respectively. In male and female
mice, 33% and 13–22%, respectively, of the administered dose were excreted in
the urine as 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole.
Urinary metabolites that were identified by GC/MS after a single dose of
safrole was administered by intraperitoneal injection to rats (50 mg/kg bw) or guineapigs (125 mg/kg bw) included the O-demethylenation metabolite (1,2-dihydroxy-4allylbenzene), 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole, the hydrolysis metabolite of the epoxide (3,4methylenedioxy-1-(2ƍ,3ƍ-dihydroxypropyl)benzene), the oxidized metabolite of the
epoxidized/hydrolysed product (2-hydroxy-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propanoic
acid and 3,4-methylenedioxybenzoylglycine) and the metabolite formed from
O-demethylenation and epoxidation/hydrolysis (1,2-dihydroxy-4-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)benzene). When safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide was administered to rats and guineapigs, the same epoxide-derived metabolites were observed in the urine of both
species. A small amount of unchanged safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide was also found in the
urine of both species, indicating that the epoxide was sufficiently stable in vivo to
circulate in the blood and to be excreted in urine (Stillwell et al., 1974).
Specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered
myristicin dissolved in propylene glycol at 100 mg/kg bw. The urine was collected
for 24 h and treated with ȕ-glucuronidase, and the metabolites were analysed.
The O-demethylenation metabolite (5-methoxy-3,4-dihydroxyallylbenzene) and
1ƍ-hydroxymyristicin were found as the two primary metabolites present in the urine,
predominantly as glucuronic acid conjugates (Lee et al., 1998).
A dose of either estragole or safrole at 1.85 mmol/kg bw was administered
by intraperitoneal injection to 21-day-old mice, and the urine was analysed for
1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites 24 h later. The doses correspond to 274 mg estragole/kg bw
and 300 mg safrole/kg bw. Approximately 23% of the estragole and 12% of the
safrole were recovered as the corresponding 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites from the urine

368

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

sample after 24 h, whereas adult male mice (9–12 weeks) excreted up to 46% of
the 300 mg/kg bw intraperitoneal dose of safrole as 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole within the
same time frame (Drinkwater et al., 1976). Less than 1% of the 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolite could be extracted prior to treatment with ȕ-glucuronidase, indicating that
the majority of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites are present in the urine as the glucuronic
acid conjugates.
A single dose of estragole, methyl eugenol or safrole at 200 mg/kg bw was
administered by intraperitoneal injection to male Wistar rats, and urine was collected
every 2 h for 24 h. Twenty-four hours after treatment, animals were terminated and
the livers were removed. Urinary metabolites included the epoxide of the parent
substance, demethylenated safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide and the O-demethylated
metabolites of methyl eugenol (allylcatechol epoxide) and estragole (allylphenol
epoxide). Liver homogenates showed the presence of safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide
metabolites but not those of methyl eugenol or estragole. Liver microsomal
preparations showed the presence of epoxide metabolites that were previously
identified in the urine for all three substances (Delaforge et al., 1978).
The predominance in formation of the O-demethylenation metabolites of
safrole, myristicin and apiole at low dose levels in rodents and humans is analogous
to the extent of O-demethylation of estragole, methyl eugenol and elemicin in the
same species. The predominance of metabolism of the aromatic alkoxy substituent
at low dose levels in humans has also been reported for the structurally related
4-methoxypropenylbenzene (trans-anethole) (Sangster et al., 1987; Caldwell &
Sutton, 1988; Newberne et al., 1999).
The formation of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole is dose dependent in both mice and
rats (Zangouras et al., 1981). When [14C-methoxy]estragole at dose levels of 0.05,
5, 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw was administered to rats orally and to mice intraperitoneally, the proportion of the dose excreted in the urine as the glucuronic acid
conjugate of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole increased with dose, and the formation of the Odemethylated metabolite decreased with dose. Only 0.9% of the dose was excreted
in the urine of rats given 0.05 mg/kg bw, whereas 8.0% was found at
1000 mg/kg bw. The total body burden after 24 h and exposure to the 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolite increased significantly (1224–255 000 nmol/kg bw) as the dose was
increased from 5 to 500 mg/kg bw. Conversely, the same increase in dose resulted
in a decrease in O-demethylation from approximately 40% to 20% in both mice and
rats. Therefore, a shift in metabolic pathways results in a marked increase in
exposure to the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite and its sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates
as dose is increased. Also, the dose-dependent increase in excreted glucuronic acid
conjugate of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite is, to a large extent, correlated with increased
dose-dependent formation of protein and DNA adducts (see below).
Based on radiolabelled studies with low oral doses of estragole, the 1ƍhydroxylation pathway is a minor pathway for the metabolism of alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes in humans. Two male volunteers ingested a gelatin capsule
containing 100 μg [methoxy-14C]estragole (1.5 μg/kg bw). The bulk (72% and 67%)
of the radioactivity was accounted for in the urine and as exhaled carbon dioxide
(respectively) within 48 h. O-Demethylation and oxidative degradation of the allyl

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

369

side-chain (i.e. 4-methoxyhippuric acid, the glycine conjugate of 4-methoxycinnamic
acid and 4-methoxyphenyllactic acid) accounted for the majority of the urinary
metabolites. Urinary 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole as the glucuronic acid conjugate
accounted for an average of only 0.3% of the total dose (Sangster et al., 1987).
As in other rodent metabolism studies, higher dose levels produce
measurable levels of 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite that can be quantified in the urine. A
100 mg/kg bw dose of estragole given to rats by the oral or intraperitoneal route was
excreted in the urine mainly as the O-demethylation product 4-allylphenol (39% oral
or 46% intraperitoneal) within 48 h (see Figure 2). Approximately 5–10% of the dose
was excreted as the 1ƍ-hydroxylation metabolite, 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole. Other
metabolites accounting for 17% of the oral dose or 31% of the intraperitoneal dose
included the product of epoxidation, hydration and subsequent oxidation of the
terminal alcohol (3-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid) of the allyl sidechain and the products of alkene isomerization, oxidation of the resulting C3 position
and ȕ-oxidation, yielding 4-methoxybenzoic acid and 4-methoxyhippuric acid
(Solheim & Scheline, 1973).
At low doses in humans, mice and rats, significant amounts of safrole,
myristicin, estragole or methyl eugenol are O-dealkylated; as dose levels increase,
1ƍ-hydroxylation and epoxidation of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes increase. The
total daily urinary production of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite increases significantly, as
much as 6000 times, as the dose of estragole increases from 50 μg/kg bw to
50 mg/kg bw (a 1000-fold increase) and the metabolism shifts to the CYP-catalysed
1ƍ-hydroxylation pathway (roughly a 6-fold increase) (Zangouras et al., 1981;
Anthony et al., 1987). Data on metabolite identification and quantification for rats
given different doses (0.9–600 mg/kg bw) of safrole demonstrate similar effects of
dose on metabolic shifting. These studies support the conclusion that the
combination of increased dose and metabolic shifting results in significant increases
in tissue concentrations and total body burden of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite
(Benedetti et al., 1977). However, it is unlikely that the human liver is exposed to
significant levels of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites and the 1ƍ-sulfoxy metabolites of the
allylbenzenes at daily intakes of 1–2 mg/person per day (17–33 μg/kg bw per day),
as would occur from daily consumption of spices and spice oils and use as a
flavouring ingredient. Biochemical evidence for this conclusion is 1) the rapid and
almost complete clearance of radioactivity in humans dosed with labelled safrole
and estragole at levels similar to normal daily intake; 2) lack of any detectable levels
of 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites in urine in humans administered relatively large doses of
nutmeg containing myristicin, safrole or elemicin; 3) urinary excretion of low levels
(0.3%) of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites by humans who were administered alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes (estragole); and 4) the presence of metabolic shifting in
rodents, in which the proportion (1–2%) and level of measured radioactivity are very
low in the liver of rodents administered low doses (<5 mg/kg bw) of radiolabelled
alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes, but the proportion (>20%) and the level are higher
at higher dose levels (50–1200 mg/kg bw).
Dosing of rodents with high levels of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes in this
group resulted in a marked increase in production of the urinary 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolite. Increased 1ƍ-hydroxylation of safrole, myristicin, estragole or methyl

370

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

eugenol is reflected by dose-dependent increases in urinary levels of this metabolite
(e.g. for estragole, <1.0% at 0.05 mg/kg bw, increasing to 3.6% at 5 mg/kg bw and
7.6% at 500 mg/kg bw; for safrole, not detected at 0.9 mg/kg bw, but 4–5% at
600 mg/kg bw) (Benedetti et al., 1977; Zangouras et al., 1981). The additional
observation that the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites of myristicin, safrole and elemicin are
present in the urine of rats administered each substance at 100 mg/kg bw via oral
intubation but absent from the urine of rodents or humans consuming nutmeg
(containing 1–2 or 3–4 mg myristicin/kg bw and lesser amounts of safrole and
elemicin) suggests that dose or possibly a matrix effect plays a key role in the
metabolite profile of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes. The matrix effect may result
from a specific highly effective inhibitor present within the complex food or a number
of low-activity, nonspecific materials that collectively reduce the hydroxylation
activity (see section 2.1.3).
The observation that the 1ƍ-hydroxylation pathway is utilized more at higher
levels of intake (i.e. >10 mg/kg bw) provides an understanding for the observation
that protein and DNA adducts were first detected in early studies at high dose levels.
As DNA and protein adduct methodology has evolved and detection limits have
decreased, adduct formation has been identified even at levels of exposure similar
to those for humans consuming spices and spice oils containing alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzene constituents. However, based on studies in humans and rodents at
lower dose levels (<10 mg/kg bw), the levels of available 1ƍ-sulfoxy metabolite and
corresponding protein and DNA adduct levels are below levels that exert detectable
adverse effects (i.e. far below the no-observed-effect level [NOEL]). The
pharmacokinetic and metabolic data in humans and animals support the conclusion
that the presence of the reactive metabolite is very low at typical human exposure
levels of about 400–600 μg/person per day.
2.1.3 Related biochemistry studies
In vitro studies have been performed to elucidate the various reactions
involved in the 1ƍ-hydroxylation, sulfation and glucuronidation pathways. The effect
of animal species and chemical structure on the involved enzyme-catalysed
reactions has been the major focus of most recent research.
Microsomes isolated from the liver of rats or humans that were either not
dosed or predosed with phenobarbital were incubated with 100 μmol myristicin/l.
The two predominant metabolites identified were the O-demethylenation
product (5-methoxy-3,4-dihydroxyallylbenzene) and 1ƍ-hydroxymyristicin. The Odemethylenation metabolite accounted for 89.9 ± 4.5% and 73.8 ± 0.7% of the
metabolites formed by phenobarbital-induced rat and human microsomes,
respectively, and 84.1 ± 3.1% and 83.0 ± 2.5% of the metabolites formed by pooled
rat and human microsomes, respectively (Swezey et al., 2003).
In an investigation of isoforms of CYP involved in human hepatic 1ƍhydroxylation of safrole, 1ƍ-hydroxylation activities of human liver microsomes and
Escherichia coli membranes expressing bicistronic human CYP isoforms were
evaluated. Human liver (n = 18) microsomal 1ƍ-hydroxylation activities were in the
range of 3.5–16.9 (mean 8.7 ± 0.7) nmol/min per milligram protein, and mean

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

371

Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum rate (Vmax) values were 5.7 ± 1.2
mmol/l and 0.14 ± 0.03 mmol/min per nanomole CYP, respectively. 1ƍ-Hydroxylation
was sensitive to the presence of an inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoform,
sulfaphenazole, and the CYP2E1 isoform inhibitors 4-methylpyrazole and
diethyldithiocarbamate. The liver microsomal 1ƍ-hydroxylation activity was
significantly correlated with tolbutamide hydroxylation (R = 0.569) and
chlorzoxazone hydroxylation (R = 0.770) activities, which were the model reactions
catalysed by CYP2C9 and CYP2E1, respectively. Human CYP2C9 and CYP2E1
exhibited activities at least 2-fold higher than those of the other CYP isoforms.
CYP2E1 showed an intrinsic clearance that was 3-fold greater than that of CYP2C9.
These results demonstrated that human hepatic CYP2C9 and CYP2E1 were the
main CYPs involved in the 1ƍ-hydroxylation of safrole (Ueng et al., 2004).
Human CYP enzymes involved in the formation of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite
of estragole, methyl eugenol and safrole were evaluated (Jeurissen et al., 2004,
2005, 2007). Safrole was incubated either with Supersomes (baculovirus-infected
insect cell microsomes that express individual human CYP enzymes to a high level)
or with microsomes derived from cell lines that express individual human CYP
enzymes to a lower, more typical human liver level. In addition, safrole was
incubated with a series of 15 human liver microsomes, and the 1ƍ-hydroxylation
rates were measured and correlated with the activities of these microsomes
towards specific substrates for nine different isoenzymes. In the final phase of the
study, pooled human liver microsomes were incubated with safrole in the presence
and absence of coumarin, a selective CYP2A6 substrate. High-performance liquid
chromatographic analysis of samples of the Supersome incubations identified
isoforms CYP2C9*1, CYP2A6, CYP2D6*1 and CYP2E1 as playing a role in the
bioactivation of safrole to 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole. The authors discussed the potential
effect of polymorphisms in CYP2C9, CYP2A6 and CYP2D6 that lead to poor
metabolizer phenotypes, which may reduce the relative risk of harm from
1ƍ-hydroxylation of safrole. Conversely, inducers of CYP2E1 (e.g. alcohol abuse)
and of CYP2C9 (e.g. barbiturates) and polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and CYP2A6
that lead to ultra-extensive metabolizer phenotypes may increase the relative risk.
In similar experiments with estragole (Jeurissen et al., 2007) and methyl eugenol
(Jeurissen et al., 2005), incubation with Supersomes revealed that all isoforms
tested except CYP2C8 intrinsically convert estragole to 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole, and
CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 intrinsically convert methyl eugenol to 1ƍhydroxymethyl eugenol. Experiments with Gentest microsomes indicated that CYPs
1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 contribute to 1ƍ-hydroxylation of estragole, and CYPs
1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 contribute to 1ƍ-hydroxylation of methyl eugenol. CYP1A2
was concluded to be an important 1ƍ-hydroxylation isoform based on correlations
between its activity, estragole 1ƍ-hydroxylation in human liver microsomal samples
and inhibition of estragole 1ƍ-hydroxylation by the CYP1A2 inhibitor Įnaphthoflavone. Kinetic studies revealed that at physiologically relevant
concentrations of estragole and methyl eugenol, CYP1A2/CYP2A6 and CYP1A2,
respectively, are the most important enzymes for bioactivation in the human liver.
It is only at relatively high estragole concentrations that CYPs 2C19, 2D6 and
2E1 might contribute to 1ƍ-hydroxylation. For methyl eugenol, enzyme efficiency
(kcat/Km, where kcat is the turnover number) of CYP1A2 is roughly 30, 50 and >50
times higher than that of CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6, respectively. Competitive

372

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

interactions between the 1ƍ-hydroxylation of estragole and methyl eugenol and
between the 1ƍ-hydroxylation of estragole and safrole are to be expected owing to
the overlapping specificities of CYP1A2 and CYP2A6, respectively, in the 1ƍhydroxylation of the substances. Furthermore, poor metabolizing phenotypes in
CYP2A6 polymorphisms may reduce the extent of 1ƍ-hydroxylation products of
estragole and safrole, whereas lifestyle factors that increase CYP1A2 activities,
such as cigarette smoking and consumption of charbroiled food, might increase the
potential for 1ƍ-hydroxylation of estragole and methyl eugenol.
The effects of estragole, safrole and myristicin on in vitro activities of CYPs
3A4, 2D6 and 1A in human liver microsomes were investigated. Estragole, safrole
or myristicin at concentrations ranging from 10 nmol/l to 150 μmol/l was incubated
with pooled microsomes, and CYP activities were measured. Safrole was a more
potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (median inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 0.43 μmol/l) and
CYP1A (IC50 = 2 μmol/l) compared with estragole and myristicin (estragole: IC50 =
5.9 μmol/l [CYP3A4] and 20 μmol/l [CYP1A]; myristicin: IC50 = 11 μmol/l [CYP3A4]
and 5 μmol/l [CYP1A]). None of the three compounds influenced CYP2D6 activity
in the concentration ranges studied. These results indicate that estragole, safrole
and myristicin may interfere with substances that are substrates for CYP3A4 and
CYP1A (Iyer et al., 2003).
In another study, CYPs 3A4 and 1A2 were identified as being the primary
isoforms involved in the hepatic biotransformation of myristicin to its major
metabolite, 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-dihydroxybenzene. Different human liver
microsomes were incubated with myristicin. The formation of 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3dihydroxybenzene strongly correlated (R2 = 0.87) with nifedipine oxidation, which is
a marker of CYP3A4 activity. Microsomal oxidation of myristicin to the major
metabolite (5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-dihydroxybenzene) was markedly inhibited by
gestodene and ketoconazole, which are selective inhibitors of the CYP3A enzyme.
Inhibitors specific to other CYP isoforms did not significantly inhibit myristicin
oxidation. Antibodies for CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 could also inhibit the oxidation of
myristicin, but antibodies recognizing other CYP isoforms had no effect. Purified
recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were capable of catalysing the oxidation of
myristicin to 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-dihydroxybenzene. These experiments indicate
that CYP3A4 (and possibly other CYP3A enzymes) and CYP1A2 play significant
roles in the formation of the major myristicin metabolite, 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3dihydroxybenzene, in humans (Yun et al., 2003).
Immunoblot analysis of liver tissue isolated from male and female rats
maintained on diets containing methyl eugenol at levels calculated to provide an
average daily intake of 0, 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg bw for 28 days showed no influence on
CYP2E1 or CYP1A2 expression levels. Gavage doses of 50 mg/kg bw per day given
to rats for 28 days showed the same lack of effect on CYP expression (Ellis, 2007).
2.1.4 Enzyme induction and inhibition
Induction of CYP1A by myristicin and safrole was evaluated in Wistar rats,
CD-1 mice and Syrian golden hamsters. Each species received daily intraperitoneal
injections of safrole or myristicin at 50 mg/kg bw for 3 days, and CYP1A activity was
measured in liver, kidney and lung tissue samples. Safrole produced a 9-fold
increase in 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) activity in the livers of rats, a

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

373

1-fold increase in hamsters and a 3-fold decrease in mice. Myristicin caused a
4-fold increase in EROD activity in rat liver, nearly half the increase seen for safrole.
No increase in EROD activity in the lung or kidney was observed for either
substance (Iwasaki et al., 1986).
Myristicin was administered to groups of four male Sprague-Dawley rats at
doses of 10–5000 μmol/kg bw by intraperitoneal injection. A dose-dependent
increase of CYP activities was reported, reaching a maximum at 500 μmol/kg bw.
At that concentration, the activity reached a maximum at 24 h for CYP1A1/CYP1A2
and CYP2B1/CYP2B2 and at 12 h for CYP2E1. Immunoblotting analysis indicated
that the increase in CYP enzyme activities was accompanied by increases in CYP
apoprotein content, and northern blot analysis showed that the induction of
CYP1A1/CYP1A2 and CYP2B1/CYP2B2 was also accompanied by a
corresponding increase in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding these
proteins. For CYP2E1, induction was not accompanied by an increase in CYP2E1
mRNA (Jeong & Yun, 1995).
In a study of the reversible and irreversible inhibition of isoenzymes of GST
by alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes, purified Į-, μ- and Ŧ-class isoenzymes of GST
(10–30 nmol/l) prepared from rat and human liver were incubated with different
concentrations of methyl eugenol and other hydroxy- and methoxyallylbenzene
derivatives. Immediately after incubation, conjugation activity was measured using
1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as a substrate. In rat liver, all classes of GST
isoenzymes were most strongly inhibited by methyl eugenol, whereas in human
liver, GST inhibition capacity was similar for all allylbenzene derivatives
(Rompelberg et al., 1996).
In studies probing the effect of structure, species and CYP enzyme induction,
incubation of methyl eugenol with rat and human liver microsomes indicates that
1ƍ-hydroxylation is catalysed predominantly by CYP2E1 and probably CYP2C6. The
rate of 1ƍ-hydroxylation of methyl eugenol varied widely in 13 human liver microsome
samples (37-fold), but the highest activities were similar to the activities in control
rat liver microsomes (Gardner et al., 1997a). At low substrate concentrations in
control rat liver microsomes, 1ƍ-hydroxylation of methyl eugenol was induced by
phenobarbital, isosafrole and dexamethasone, but significantly inhibited by
diallylsulfide (40%), Į-naphthoflavone (25%) and p-nitrophenol (55%).
Treatment of mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 (Hepa-1) cells with myristicin
increased CYP1A1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by
analysis of EROD activity, quantification of CYP1A1 protein levels and
determination of CYP1A1 mRNA levels. In a competitive aryl hydrocarbon (Ah)
receptor binding analysis, myristicin did not competitively displace [3H]2,3,7,8tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin from the Hepa-1 cytosolic (Ah) receptor, and it did not
affect formation of DNA–protein complexes between the Ah receptor and its dioxinresponsive enhancer (DRE) target in a gel mobility shift assay using
oligonucleotides corresponding to DRE 3 of CYP1A1. These results suggest that
induction of CYP1A1 in Hepa-1 cells by myristicin might occur through an Ah
receptor–independent pathway (Jeong et al., 1997).

374

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

GST activity in the liver increased 4.3-fold and in the small intestine 3.2-fold
after 10 mg of myristicin was given by gavage to female A/J mice every 2 days for
a total of 30 mg (Zheng et al., 1992).
Albino mice given doses of myristicin (5–50 mg) by gavage showed a 4- to
14-fold increase in liver GST activity over the control. An increase in GST activity
towards 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene and an increase in the levels of GST μ on western
blot analysis of the myristicin-treated mouse liver suggest a preferential induction
of GST μ. Of the two GST μ subunits expressed in liver, only one was significantly
elevated. Myristicin treatment caused a slight change in the GST Ŧ levels, whereas
the levels of GST Į showed a modest increase (Ahmad et al., 1997).
2.1.5 Oxidative stress and cytotoxicity
Oxidative stress and the protective effects of glutathione have been reported
in animals exposed to alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes.
A dose-dependent increase in the formation of hepatic lipid hydroperoxides
(LHP) and 8-hydroxy-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) was reported when SpragueDawley rats were given single intraperitoneal injections of 0, 250, 500 or 1000 mg
safrole/kg bw. LHP peaked on day 3 and gradually returned to the basal level on
day 15. Levels of 8-OH-dG peaked on day 5 and returned to the basal level on day
15. Safrole administration was associated with increased serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Dietary
supplements of the antioxidants vitamin E, deferoxamine and N-acetylcysteine
reduced safrole-induced oxidative damage, with the glutathione precursor Nacetylcysteine exerting the greatest protective effect. Addition of the glutathione
synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, enhanced the safrole-induced oxidative
damage, as evidenced by the elevation of LHP and 8-OH-dG levels on day 3 (P <
0.05). These findings suggest that, at high doses, safrole treatment induces
oxidative damage in rat hepatic tissue, and that glutathione plays a protective role
(Liu et al., 2000).
The associations of genetic polymorphisms of SULT1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1
and GSTP1 with DNA oxidative damage were evaluated among betel quid chewers
exposed to significant levels of safrole. Safrole can be bioactivated by hepatic
sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) or detoxicated by GSTs (GSTM1, GSTT1 and
GSTP1). A biomarker for oxidative stress, urinary 8-OH-dG level, was analysed
using isotope dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/
MS) in 64 betel quid chewers and 129 non–betel quid chewers. Data on
demographics and habits (smoking, alcohol drinking and betel quid chewing) were
obtained from questionnaires. Urinary 8-OH-dG levels were higher in chewers with
SULT1A1 Arg-His genotype than in chewers with SULT1A1 Arg-Arg genotype.
Urinary 8-OH-dG levels were also higher in chewers with GSTP1 Ile-Ile genotype.
Furthermore, the combined effect of SULT1A1 and GSTP1 genotypes on urinary
8-OH-dG was evaluated. Non-chewers with both SULT1A1 Arg-Arg and GSTP1
Val-Val/Ile-Val (reference group) had the lowest mean 8-OH-dG level (3.6 ng/mg
creatinine), whereas chewers with either SULT1A1 Arg-His or GSTP1 Ile-Ile had
the highest mean 8-OH-dG level (6.2 ng/mg creatinine; versus reference group,

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

375

P = 0.04). Chewers with a SULT1A1 Arg-Arg and GSTP1 Val-Val/Ile-Val genotype
(4.6 ng/mg creatinine) and non-chewers with either SULT1A1 Arg-His or GSTP1
Ile-Ile genotypes (4.7 ng/mg creatinine) had a moderately increased 8-OH-dG level.
Thus, the susceptible SULT1A1 and GSTP1 genotypes may modulate increased
DNA oxidative stress elicited by betel quid chewing (Wong et al., 2008).
The cytotoxic and genotoxic potentials of methyl eugenol, safrole, eugenol
and isoeugenol were evaluated using cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from
male Fischer 344 rats and female B6C3F1 mice. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
release was used to assess cytotoxicity, whereas the UDS assay was used to
assess genotoxicity. Rat and mouse hepatocytes showed similar patterns of toxicity
for each chemical tested. Methyl eugenol and safrole were relatively non-cytotoxic
but caused UDS at concentrations between 10 and 500 μmol/l. In contrast,
isoeugenol and eugenol produced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes with median lethal
concentration (LC50) values of approximately 200–300 μmol/l, but did not cause
UDS. Concurrent incubation of cyclohexane oxide, an epoxide hydrolase
competitor, at 2000 μmol/l with a non-cytotoxic concentration of methyl eugenol
(10 μmol/l) resulted in increased cytotoxicity but had no effect on genotoxicity.
However, incubation of pentachlorophenol, a SULT inhibitor, at 15 μmol/l with
10 μmol methyl eugenol/l resulted in increased cytotoxicity and significantly reduced
genotoxicity. These results suggest that methyl eugenol is similar to safrole in its
ability to cause cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in rodents. It appears that the
bioactivation of methyl eugenol to a DNA-reactive electrophile is mediated by a
SULT in rodents, but epoxide formation is not responsible for the observed
genotoxicity (Burkey et al., 2000).
The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of myristicin on the human
neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were evaluated. A dose-dependent reduction in cell
viability occurs at a myristicin concentration of 0.5 mmol/l in SK-N-SH cells.
Apoptotic cell death was monitored using DNA fragmentation, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated 2ƍ-deoxyuridine-5ƍ-triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end
labelling and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. The apoptosis triggered by
myristicin was accompanied by an accumulation of cytochrome c and by the
activation of caspase-3. The results obtained suggest that myristicin induces
cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells by an apoptotic mechanism
(Lee et al., 2005).
2.1.6 Protein adducts
The dose-related formation of protein adducts has been indirectly related to
observed hepatotoxicity in studies with safrole, estragole and methyl eugenol in
rodents. In repeated oral dose studies in rats, low doses (10 or 30 mg/kg bw per
day for 5 days) of methyl eugenol have been shown to produce a single 44 kilodalton
(kDa) microsomal protein adduct; the protein adduct is likely formed from the
reaction of the electrophilic 1ƍ-hydroxylation metabolite (carbonium ion) with a
precursor to the 67 kDa laminin receptor, which is a peripheral membrane
glycoprotein involved in tumour cell invasion and metastasis (Gardner et al., 1997b).
At higher dose levels (100 and 300 mg/kg bw per day), this protein adduct is also
the major product, but as many as 20 other protein adducts are formed. The

376

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

formation of protein adducts has been directly related to the formation of the
1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite in a dose-related manner (Borchert et al., 1973; Gardner
et al., 1995). The 44 kDa adduct was reported in vitro when the 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolite (50 μmol/l) was incubated with rat hepatocytes; at a higher concentration
(500 μmol/l), additional protein adducts were observed (Gardner et al., 1995, 1996).
A marked increase in methyl eugenol–protein adducts occurred when CYP
was induced by an assortment of inducers, including dexamethasone. Autoinduction of the 1ƍ-hydroxylation pathway was reported in hepatic microsomes of
rats given 30–300 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw per day orally for 5 days, but was not
observed in rats given 10 mg/kg bw per day for 5 days (Gardner et al., 1997a).
Dose levels of 100, 300 or 500 mg estragole/kg bw were administered orally
as single doses in 0.5% weight by volume (w/v) methyl cellulose or by repeated
daily doses to male Fischer rats for 5 days. Control animals received an equivalent
volume of 0.5% methyl cellulose solution. Livers were removed from rats
immediately after sacrifice, and hepatic protein adducts were detected by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using
antisera raised by immunizing rabbits with 4-methoxycinnamic acid–modified rabbit
serum albumin. A major 155 kDa adduct was expressed in the livers of animals that
received all doses of estragole. Other protein adducts (170, 100, 44 and 35 kDa)
were also detected in the high-dose group. Rats administered estragole for 5 days
at 300 mg/kg bw per day expressed predominately 155 and 44 kDa adducts, with
lower levels of the 100 and 35 kDa adducts detected. Adduct levels also increased
disproportionately with respect to dose and were roughly 250-fold higher in livers of
rats administered a single dose of estragole at 500 mg/kg bw than in animals dosed
with the compound at 100 mg/kg bw. The 155, 100, 44 and 35 kDa adducts were
detected in greatest abundance in liver microsomal fractions, whereas the 170 kDa
adduct was most abundant in the nuclear fraction. Some adducts (i.e. 170, 155, 100
and 35 kDa) were detected in the cytosolic fractions, whereas relatively low levels
of the 44 kDa adduct were detected in the nuclear fractions and not in the cytosolic
fractions (Wakazono et al., 1998).
2.1.7 DNA adducts
(a)

Rodent DNA adducts

In studies beginning in the early 1980s (Miller et al., 1983), safrole, myristicin,
methyl eugenol and estragole, their 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites and the corresponding
sulfate esters of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites were shown to form DNA adducts in
vivo and in vitro. In early studies, high doses were administered to achieve a
carcinogenic effect, whereas in more recent studies, multiple dose levels have been
administered to evaluate the dose–response relationship.
Dose-dependent formation of safrole–DNA adducts has been studied in rats
(Daimon et al., 1998). Male Fischer rats were given either single oral doses of 0, 1,
10, 100, 250 or 500 mg safrole/kg bw or five successive daily doses of 62.5, 125 or
250 mg safrole/kg bw. Two major DNA adducts (N2-(trans-isosafrole-3ƍ-yl)-2ƍdeoxyguanosine and N2-(safrole-1ƍ-yl)-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine) and two unidentified

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

377

minor adducts were detected in liver tissue. A clear linear dose–response
relationship existed between total DNA adducts in rats treated with single oral doses
at 10 (3.2 total adducts/107 nucleotides), 100 (16.3/107 nucleotides), 250
(30.3/107 nucleotides) or 500 (72/107 nucleotides) mg/kg bw by gavage or in rats
administered five successive daily doses of 62.5 (43/107 nucleotides), 125 (67/107
nucleotides) or 250 (90/107 nucleotides) mg/kg bw by gavage (see Figure 4). There
was no difference between levels of DNA adducts of controls and those at the 1 mg/
kg bw dose level. The lack of DNA adducts at 1 mg/kg bw is consistent with the lack
of any detectable adducts in rats fed 1 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw per day in the diet
for 28 days (Ellis et al., 2006).

DNA adducts/10 nucleotides

Female CD-1 mice were administered 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.10, 1.0 or 10 mg of
safrole (corresponding to roughly 0.040–400 mg/kg bw) by intraperitoneal injection
and then sacrificed at various time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7, 18 and 30 days). Groups
of animals (three per group) at the 10 mg dose were also sacrificed at 1, 3 and 6 h.
Determination of peak liver safrole–DNA adducts that occurred at 2 days showed a
linear (slope = 1) relationship between total relative adduct levels and concentration.
Relative adduct levels were in the range from <1 adduct/108 nucleotides at 0.001
mg to >1000 adducts/108 nucleotides at the 10 mg dose (~400 mg/kg bw), with the
mid-dose of 0.10 mg (~4 mg/kg bw) showing 30–40 adducts/108 nucleotides at 2
days. Two of the four adducts detected were identified as N2-(trans-isosafrole-3ƍyl)-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine and N2-(safrole-1ƍ-yl)-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine. For doses of 0.01–
10 mg, total adduct levels peaked at day 2 and were present for the 30-day duration

378

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

of the study. The persistence of adducts at 0.001 mg was not assessed. Evidence
of UDS occurred only at 2, 3 and 7 days for the 10 mg dose (Gupta et al., 1993).
In experiments using labelled 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole, adult female CD-1 mice
(mean weight 35 g) were given 12 μmol of [2ƍ,3ƍ-3H]1ƍ-hydroxyestragole per mouse
(58 mg/kg bw) by intraperitoneal injection in trioctanoin, and DNA adduct formation
was monitored over 20 days post-exposure. Similarly, 9-day-old male or female
B6C3F1 mice (mean weight 6 g) were injected intraperitoneally with a dose of
0.5 μmol (14 mg/kg bw) of labelled estragole and sacrificed after 23 h. Three
adducts were formed by reaction on the exocyclic amino group (N2) of
deoxyguanosine with estragole at either the 1ƍ or 3ƍ position (cis or trans isomers).
An additional adduct was formed by the reaction of the 3ƍ position of estragole and
the N6 position of deoxyadenosine. Unlike adducts of aromatic amines (e.g. Nacetyl-2-aminofluorene), which persist at near maximum levels of binding for
several weeks, the three adducts of estragole–deoxyribonucleoside were removed
rapidly from mouse liver DNA. Time course quantification of DNA adducts indicated
a biphasic loss curve, with a sharp decline in one of the two major 1ƍhydroxyestragole adducts by day 1, followed by relatively constant levels of liver
DNA adducts from day 3 to day 20. This suggests that at least one of the adducts
undergoes excision repair. Dose levels of the 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole in the adult
female and pre-weanling male and female mice were approximately 58 mg/kg bw
and 14 mg/kg bw, respectively (Phillips et al., 1981).
Adult female CD-1 mice (mean weight 25 g) received intraperitoneal
injections of 2 or 10 mg estragole, methyl eugenol, safrole, apiole, elemicin,
myristicin, anethole, allylbenzene or isosafrole, and liver DNA samples were
collected 24 h later. The dose levels in this study were equivalent to 100 or 500 mg/
kg bw of each test substance. 32P-Postlabelling analysis revealed that safrole,
methyl eugenol and estragole showed higher DNA-binding activities relative to the
other alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene substances examined in the study. Similar to
the previous experiment, a rapid drop in total adduct formation occurred within 7
days after dosing and was followed by a relatively constant level over the next 140
days, suggesting that DNA repair processes were operative shortly after dosing
(Randerath et al., 1984).
In a related 32P-postlabelling experiment (Phillips et al., 1984), newborn male
B6C3F1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 μmol of
the same series of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 after
birth, respectively. Dose levels of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole and 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole were
estimated to be approximately 27 and 35 mg/kg bw, respectively. Mice were
terminated on days 23, 29 and 43, and their liver DNA was isolated and analysed.
The highest DNA adduct levels were measured for methyl eugenol (72.7 pmol/mg
DNA), estragole (30 pmol/mg DNA) and safrole (17.5 pmol/mg DNA), and a
significant (P < 0.05) amount of adduct was detected at 43 days. Lower levels of
DNA binding by myristicin (7.8 pmol/mg DNA) and elemicin (3.7 pmol/mg DNA) were
also found; in the former case, the adducts were less persistent. Very low levels of
DNA adducts (<1.4 pmol/mg DNA) were detected with apiole and a structurally
related substance, dill apiole (2,3-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyallylbenzene).
Based on these results and those from a study of the carcinogenic activity of these

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

379

substances in the same species and strain (Miller et al., 1983), the authors
concluded that DNA adduct levels of at least 15 pmol/mg of DNA at 23 days were
required for statistically significant tumorigenesis potential (Phillips et al., 1984). The
authors also noted that, compared with adults, newborn mice showed greater
sensitivity to alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene carcinogenicity.
In a dose-dependent study of formation of methyl eugenol–DNA adducts,
groups of male and female Fischer 344 rats were maintained on diets providing 0,
1, 5 or 50 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw for 28 days. The positive control (DNA harvested
from rats treated with 300 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw) showed clear evidence of DNA
adducts in the liver as measured by 32P-postlabelling. The dietary vehicle control
and the gavage vehicle control groups showed no evidence of methyl eugenol–DNA
adducts in the liver. In both cases, 32P-postlabelled adducts were below the limit of
detection of the assay (<0.2 adducts/108 nucleotides). In contrast, the livers of rats
fed 50 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw and those gavaged with methyl eugenol (50 mg/
kg bw) showed evidence of DNA adducts (mean values approximately 81 and 37
adducts/108 nucleotides, respectively). DNA adducts were also detected in the livers
of the rats given 5 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw in the diet, although the levels were
near the limit of detection (~1 adduct/108 nucleotides). In rats given the lowest dose
of methyl eugenol (1 mg/kg bw), the level of liver methyl eugenol–DNA adducts was
below the limit of detection (<0.2 adducts/108 nucleotides) (Ellis, 2007).
In the same experiments, stomach tissue was also evaluated for DNA
adducts. The positive control (DNA harvested from rats treated with 300 mg methyl
eugenol/kg bw) showed measurable levels of methyl eugenol–DNA adducts (43.7
adducts/108 nucleotides). No adducts were detected in the dietary vehicle control
and the gavage vehicle control groups; in both cases, 32P-postlabelled adducts were
below the limit of detection of the assay. In contrast, the stomachs of rats fed 50 mg
methyl eugenol/kg bw and those gavaged with methyl eugenol (50 mg/kg bw) had
clear evidence of methyl eugenol–DNA adducts (~4.8 and 0.7 adducts/108
nucleotides). DNA adducts were not detected in the stomach tissue of the rats
administered 1 and 5 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw in the diet (Ellis, 2007).
In a multipart study, seven groups of female ICR mice (3–4 per group) were
maintained on water, three different brands of degassed non-diet cola drinks or
three different brands of non-cola drinks as the sole source of liquid in the diet.
Animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks and analysed for liver DNA adducts using a
monophosphate version of the 32P-postlabelling assay. The 8-week time course of
adduct formation (3–5 mice analysed at 4 days and 2, 4 and 8 weeks) was followed
in groups of mice maintained on the two cola drinks that showed the highest adduct
formation in the 4-week study. The adducts formed were identical to liver DNA
adducts isolated from groups of females given either a single dose of 10 mg of
myristicin (400 mg/kg bw) by gavage or the acetone extracts of nutmeg or mace
given in four single doses (30 mg spice/150 μl trioctanoin) over 4 days. In the 4week study, the major adduct accounting for 80% of the total adducts (100–200
adducts/109 nucleotides) was formed by myristicin, whereas safrole resulted in
5–8% of the total adducts. In the spice extract study, myristicin-derived DNA adducts
accounted for 71–81% of the total (700–3000 adducts/109 nucleotides), and safrole
produced 3.5–8.5% of the total adducts. In the myristicin study, adduct levels

380

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

reached 17 adducts/106 nucleotides, which is approximately 17–34 times the levels
achieved in the 4-week cola study. No adducts were detected in the livers of mice
administered the non-cola drink or the control groups. During the 8-week study, the
levels of both total DNA adducts and myristicin-derived DNA adducts continued to
increase and reached a maximum of 250 adducts/109 nucleotides at 8 weeks;
however, total and myristicin-derived DNA adduct levels were not significantly
different from 4-week levels. In a fourth experiment, two pregnant mice were given
either a single gavage dose of 6 mg of myristicin (300 mg/kg bw) on day 16 or two
doses on days 16 and 17 of gestation. Maternal and fetal liver DNA were isolated
24 h after dosing. Regardless of dosing regimen, myristicin-derived DNA adduct
levels reached approximately 3 times those observed in non-pregnant females. The
level of myristicin-related adducts achieved after animals were maintained on cola
drinks for 8 weeks (~20 adducts/108 nucleotides) corresponds to the level achieved
after a single dose of approximately 5–6 mg/kg bw, assuming a linear dose–
response for DNA adduct formation (Randerath et al., 1993).
(b)

Human DNA adducts

Safrole-derived DNA adducts have been identified in humans and rodents,
with the latter showing a clear dose–response relationship. Other alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes show similar patterns of dose–response for DNA adduct formation in
rodents. Studies of safrole–DNA adducts in humans are connected mainly to studies
of subpopulations that are chronic chewers of betel quid. Chewing of betel quid
occurs mainly in South-east Asia, and the betel quid is often incorporated into a
commercial mixture called gutkha. Chewing of betel quid or gutkha has been
associated with several human cancers (International Agency for Research on
Cancer, 2004). Gutkha, available in tins, is consumed by placing a pinch in the
mouth between the gum and cheek and gently sucking and chewing. The excess
saliva produced by chewing may be swallowed or spit out. The saliva of betel quid
chewers contains the alkaloid arecoline, numerous nitrosamines and safrole, with
the approximate concentration of safrole in the saliva of betel quid chewers being
420 μmol/l (Liu et al., 2000; International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2004).
Although chronic human intake of safrole from chewing betel quid (7.5 kg/year in
Taiwan, China) is significant (Wen et al., 2005), there is no strong correlation
between incidence of betel nut chewing and increased incidence of hepatocellular
neoplasms. Levels of safrole–DNA adducts in the livers of betel quid chewers with
oral and liver cancers are low (2/107 nucleotides) (Liu et al., 2000).
An increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral submucosal
fibrosis has been associated with the chronic chewing of betel quid. Piper betle
flowers contain ~15 mg safrole/g. Based on 32P-postlabelling analysis, a high
frequency of safrole-derived DNA adducts occurred in betel quid–associated oral
squamous cell carcinoma (77%, 23/30) and non-cancerous matched tissue (97%,
29/30). These adducts were not present in oral squamous cell carcinoma not
associated with betel quid chewing and their paired non-cancerous matched tissue
(P < 0.001) at the limit of detection (<1/109 nucleotides). Six of seven oral
submucosal fibrosis samples also showed the same safrole-like DNA adduct. The
DNA adduct levels were significantly higher in oral submucosal fibrosis and noncancerous matched tissues than in oral squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.05). These

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

381

adducts were identical to synthetic safrole–deoxyguanosine monophosphate
(dGMP) adducts as well as DNA adducts from 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole-treated HepG2
cells, suggesting that safrole forms stable DNA adducts in human oral tissue
following chronic betel quid chewing (Chen et al., 1999).
The liver biopsy of a patient who was both a chronic betel nut chewer (30
betel quid per day for 32 years) and a chronic cigarette smoker revealed
hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient also had oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Using the 32P-postlabelling technique, safrole–DNA adducts were detected in tissue
samples from the liver, from the oral squamous cell carcinoma and in peripheral
blood leukocyte samples. The level of safrole–DNA adducts detected was 22.5
adducts/108 nucleotides in liver, 7.1 adducts/108 nucleotides in the oral squamous
cell carcinoma and 0.8 adducts/108 nucleotides in peripheral blood leukocytes. The
profile and location of the safrole–DNA adduct were similar to those of adducts
found in HepG2 cells exposed to 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole; the adduct has been identified
as N2-(trans-isosafrole-3ƍ-yl)-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine, which has a structure analogous
to the DNA adducts formed by estragole and methyl eugenol. In parallel studies
using similar tissues obtained from six people who had hepatocellular carcinoma or
oral squamous cell carcinoma and who did not chew betel quid, no safrole-derived
DNA adducts were detected (Liu et al., 2000).
In an in vitro study, metabolically competent human hepatoma (HepG2) cells
were incubated for 24 h with three concentrations (50, 150 and 450 μmol/l) of
safrole, myristicin, apiole, estragole, methyl eugenol and the structurally related
substance dill apiole (2,3-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyallylbenzene). DNA
adducts measured by the 32P-postlabelling assay showed that all six substances
formed N2-(trans-propenylbenzene-3ƍ-yl)-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine (major) and N2(allylbenzene-1ƍ-yl)-2ƍ-deoxyguanosine (minor) adducts. At the low concentration
(50 μmol/l), the level of DNA adduct formation decreased in the order methyl
eugenol > estragole > safrole > myristicin dill apiole > apiole. At the high
concentration of 450 μmol/l, the level of adduct formation decreased in the order
estragole > myristicin > methyl eugenol § safrole > dill apiole > apiole. Also, the ratio
of major/minor DNA adducts was highest for methyl eugenol in both HepG2 cells
and mouse liver and lowest for estragole and safrole. The authors suggest that
decreased steric hindrance is related to increased formation of the minor N2(allylbenzene-1ƍ-yl) adduct (Zhou et al., 2007).
2.1.8 Summary of enzyme induction and adduct formation data
Based on research performed since the late 1990s (Gardner et al., 1997a,
1997b; Wakazono et al., 1998; Jeurissen et al., 2004, 2005, 2007; Ueng et al.,
2004), significant induction of the CYP activation pathway is expected to
successively convert alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes into their 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolites and sulfate conjugates. This is especially prevalent at higher dose
levels in rodents. Under conditions such as those present in rats and mice
administered high dose levels (>10 mg/kg bw per day), induction of CYP1A2
(Jeurissen et al., 2005) and CYP2E1 (Gardner et al., 1997a) and subsequent
sulfation (via SULT1 and SULT2) are linked sequentially to increased production of
the sulfate conjugate of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite. This metabolite is linked to GST

382

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

depletion and oxidative stress, protein adduct formation, DNA adduct formation,
effects on cell growth, hepatotoxicity and eventually carcinogenicity. In this respect,
safrole, estragole and methyl eugenol show greater toxic potential in rodents
compared with myristicin, elemicin and apiole (see below and Miller et al., 1983). In
addition to enzyme induction, a principal microsomal protein adduct (identified as
the laminin receptor for methyl eugenol) forms from estragole and methyl eugenol
at low doses (10 and 30 mg/kg bw per day); at higher doses (100 and 300 mg/kg
bw per day), an assortment of protein adducts forms (Gardner et al., 1995, 1996;
Wakazono et al., 1998).
The results of protein and DNA adduct studies that have been conducted
mainly with safrole, methyl eugenol and estragole in humans and rodents indicate
that all alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes discussed here can form covalently bound
protein and DNA adducts. Evidence supports the conclusion that the 1ƍ-hydroxy
derivative is the penultimate reactive metabolite. The 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite is
converted to the 1ƍ-sulfoxy species, which then forms protein and DNA adducts via
a reactive carbocation (Phillips et al., 1981). Studies performed at relatively high
dose levels demonstrate that the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite produces a species that
reacts with an exocyclic amine function to form a single covalent bond to the
deoxyribonucleoside (Gardner et al., 1995). Clearly, at high dose levels, DNA
adduct formation has been directly related to administration of the parent alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes or its principal hepatotoxic metabolite. Currently, sufficient
data are available on the formation of DNA adducts in dose–response studies for
safrole and methyl eugenol to conclude that at intake levels below 10 mg/kg bw,
adduct levels will be in the range of 1/107 nucleotides to 1/108 nucleotides; at 1 mg/
kg bw, adduct levels are at the limits of detection (1/108 nucleotides to 1/109
nucleotides). These levels of formation of DNA adducts have little, if any, biological
significance given that at a low dose level (1.5 mg/kg bw) of 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite,
there is no evidence of liver tumours in mice (Wiseman et al., 1987). Also, chronic
dietary studies resulting in daily intakes of 5 or 25 mg safrole/kg bw, levels shown
to produce DNA adducts, showed no evidence of a detectable incidence of hepatic
tumours in rats (Long et al., 1963). Also, there is little evidence in humans exposed
chronically to higher levels of safrole through betel quid chewing that there is an
increased risk of liver neoplasms.
DNA adducts of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes have been detected in
humans and in animals at intake levels below 1 mg/kg bw (Gupta et al., 1993). In
dose–response studies with different alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes, levels of
adduct formation are directly proportional to dose. Seminal research (Miller et al.,
1983; Phillips et al., 1984; Randerath et al., 1984; Wiseman et al., 1987) relating
the formation of DNA adducts to the incidence of hepatomas in various strains of
mice provides evidence that 1) there is no direct relationship between levels of DNA
adduct formation and incidences of tumorigenicity; and 2) repair of these types of
covalently bound DNA adducts operates in vivo, as indicated by the rapid decrease
in adduct levels following cessation of exposure to alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes.
Importantly, the low levels of DNA adducts in target or non-target tissues in humans
exposed to safrole-containing natural products have not been associated with an
increased incidence of hepatic tumours.

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

383

It appears that at dose levels below 10 mg/kg bw per day, the extent of 1ƍhydroxylation is low (Zangouras et al., 1981; Sangster et al., 1987). At higher dose
levels, induction of activation enzymes (i.e. CYP2E1) and hepatocellular protein
adduct formation become significant (Gardner et al., 1997a). Presumably, the
reactive species are effectively trapped by microsomal proteins, glutathione and
other cellular nucleophiles, probably at or near the site of formation. However,
chemical characterization of these detoxication reactions and information on the
concentrations at which these biochemical events initiate hepatotoxicity are as yet
unknown. Additional dose-dependent metabolism and toxicity data at dose levels
below 10 mg/kg bw would provide key data for a physiologically based
pharmacokinetic model. Such a model would yield a quantitative understanding of
the internal dosimetry of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes and their downstream
1ƍ-hydroxy and 1ƍ-sulfoxy metabolites in rodents and humans (Jeong & Yun, 1995).
A significant difficulty in evaluating the metabolic, biochemical and
toxicological data for these substances is that human intake of alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes results from a complex mixture of spice and spice oil constituents that
may significantly impact the biochemical fate of these substances. The genotoxic
potential of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes is likely due to the CYP-catalysed
formation of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite and subsequent SULT-catalysed formation
of the 1ƍ-sulfoxy conjugate. The presence of CYP1A2 inhibitors in the herb basil,
which contains methyl eugenol and estragole, has been demonstrated (Jeurissen
et al., 2008). Furthermore, basil extract is able to strongly inhibit sulfation and
subsequent DNA adduct formation of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole in incubations with rat
and human S9 homogenates and in the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line. These
in vitro results suggest that the adverse effects of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes
related to bioactivation by CYP and SULT enzymes may be lower in a matrix of
other herbal components than with administration of the single substances. The
rodent carcinogenicity studies conducted with these compounds involve
administration of single substances at high dose levels, whereas human intake of
these compounds in food is at much lower levels consumed in a complex food
matrix.
2.2

Toxicological studies

2.2.1 Acute toxicity
Median lethal dose (LD50) values after oral administration have been
reported for three of the six substances in this group (see Table 2), ranging from
810 to 1950 mg/kg bw for rats and from 1250 to 2350 mg/kg bw for mice. These
values indicate that the acute toxicity of methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted
allylbenzenes after oral intake is low (Jenner et al., 1964; Taylor et al., 1964; Hagan
et al., 1965; Bär & Griepentrog, 1967; Keating, 1972; Moreno, 1972; Beroza et al.,

2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
The results of short-term studies of toxicity of methoxy-and methylenedioxysubstituted allylbenzenes are summarized in Table 3.
(a)

Nutmeg oil

(i) Rats
Nutmeg oil, composed of approximately 7% myristicin, 1.3% safrole and
>80% monoterpene hydrocarbons (Į- and ȕ-pinene and sabinene) (Mills, 1989),
was administered to groups of 10 male and 10 female Fischer 344 rats for 28 days.
The test material, which was administered daily at dose levels of 0 (control), 20, 100
or 500 mg/kg bw by gavage in corn oil (10 ml/kg), was calculated to provide an intake
of 0, 1.6, 8.3 or 41.5 mg alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes/kg bw and 0, 16, 80 or
400 mg monoterpene hydrocarbons/kg bw. With the exception of one accidental
death at the highest dose, all animals survived to the scheduled sacrifice. Weekly
measurements of body weights revealed significantly decreased body weights in
males (days 22, 28 and 29) and females (day 29). Body weight gain was significantly
decreased for the 100 and 500 mg/kg bw per day groups of both sexes. Clinical
chemistry evaluation revealed increased serum phosphate and AST in the highdose males and increased mean serum creatinine in all treated males. No significant

chemistry changes were reported in females. Measurement of organ weights on
day 29 revealed statistically significant increases in absolute and relative liver
weights and decreased thymus weights in the 500 mg/kg bw per day groups of both
sexes. Male rats showed statistically significant increases in absolute and relative
kidney weights at the 100 and 500 mg/kg bw per day dose levels and decreased
testis weights at the 500 mg/kg bw per day dose level. The histopathological
evaluation was consistent with organ weight data, in that degenerative and
regenerative changes were present in the kidneys at all dose levels and
degenerative changes were present in the testes at the highest dose level. The
authors noted that the renal effects were consistent with male rat nephropathy, a
condition specific to male rats. Therefore, the renal effects in the male rat were not
considered to be a toxicity of the test material that was relevant to humans. There
was no evidence of lesions related to the administration of the test material in female
rats. Other studies using myristicin or safrole have shown that the liver is the primary
target organ. Based on the alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene composition of nutmeg
oil, the alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene lowest-observed-adverse-effect level
(LOAEL) for liver effects in both sexes is approximately 41.5 mg/kg bw per day
(8.3% alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes × 500 mg/kg bw per day), and the noobserved-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) is 8.3 mg/kg bw per day. The LOAEL for
renal effects in males, in all probability due to the presence of the significant amount
of terpene hydrocarbons (80%) in nutmeg oil, is 16 mg/kg bw per day (80% of
20 mg/kg bw per day) (Wenk, 1992).
(b)

Estragole (No. 1789)

(i) Mice
In a 93-day study with estragole, groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were
administered estragole (99% pure) at 0 (control), 37.5, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg/kg
bw by gavage once per day, 5 days a week. Animals were housed five per cage
and fed ad libitum. Body weights and clinical observations were made on day 1,
weekly and at study termination (day 93). At termination, blood was taken for clinical
chemistry determinations and haematological evaluation, and body and organ
weights (heart, brain, liver, right kidney, right testes, lungs and thymus) were
recorded. Histopathological examination was performed on a wide variety of
tissues.
In male mice, survival was 100% in all dosed groups except at the 600 mg/
kg bw per day dose level. Statistically significant decreases in body weights were
recorded for the 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day dosed groups compared with the
controls. Haematological examinations revealed decreases in erythrocytes and
increases in the number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, reticulocytes and platelets in
the 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day dose groups. Organ weight changes included
increased relative (to body weight) liver weights and decreased body weights at 300
and 600 mg/kg bw per day. Histopathological examination revealed liver alterations
at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day, including oval cell hyperplasia, hepatocyte
hypertrophy and hepatocyte degeneration, all of which were described as being
minimal or mild in severity.

388

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

Effects were less pronounced in female mice than in males. Survival was
100% for all dosed groups. Statistically significant decreases in body weights were
recorded at the 150 and 300 mg/kg bw per day levels compared with the controls.
Haematological examinations revealed decreases in erythrocytes and increases in
the number of platelets, leukocytes, lymphocytes and reticulocytes at 150 and
300 mg/kg bw per day. Organ weight changes increased the absolute and relative
(to body weight) liver weights at 300 mg/kg bw per day. Degeneration of the olfactory
epithelium of the nose occurred in all mice of both sexes given 300 and 600 mg/kg
bw per day.
Based primarily on the histopathological changes, a NOAEL of 37.5 mg/kg
bw per day and a LOAEL of 75 mg/kg bw per day are estimated for the subchronic
toxicity of estragole in male and female B6C3F1 mice (National Toxicology
Program, 2008).
(ii) Rats
In a 93-day study in rats, groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were
administered estragole (99% pure) at 0 (control), 37.5, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg/kg
bw by intragastric instillation once per day, 5 days per week. Animals were housed
five per cage and fed ad libitum. Body weights and clinical observations were made
on day 1, weekly and at study termination (day 93). At termination, blood was taken
for clinical chemistry determinations and haematological evaluation, and body and
organ weights (heart, brain, liver, right kidney, right testes, lungs and thymus) were
recorded. Histopathological examination was performed on a wide variety of
tissues.
In males, survival was 100% for all dosed groups. Statistically significant
decreases in body weights were recorded for the 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day
dose groups compared with the controls. Clinical chemistry changes were limited
mainly to the 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day dose groups; at 300 and 600 mg/kg
bw per day, increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, total protein, ALT, bile salts and
total iron-binding capacity were reported. Additionally, at 600 mg/kg bw per day,
increases in alkaline phosphatase, bile salts and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)
were noted. Haematological examinations revealed decreases in erythrocytes,
haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean cell volume and platelet counts and increases in
the number of leukocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils, but only at the 300 and
600 mg/kg bw per day dose levels. Organ weight changes included increased
absolute and relative (to body weight) liver and kidney weights and decreased body
and testis weights at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day. Absolute and relative heart
weights were also increased at the 600 mg/kg bw per day level. Histopathological
examination revealed liver alterations at 37.5 mg/kg bw per day, including bile duct
hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, hepatocyte hypertrophy and periportal
inflammation, all of which were described as being minimal. Similar alterations at
the 75 mg/kg bw per day dose level were also described as minimal. The severity
of hepatic effects at 150 mg/kg bw per day was reported to be mild, whereas the
effects at higher dose levels increased in severity (moderate and marked). At the
150 mg/kg bw per day and higher dose levels, males showed evidence of chronic
hepatic inflammation, hepatocellular necrosis, oval cell hyperplasia and hepatic
periportal fibrosis. At 600 mg/kg bw per day, cholangiofibrosis was reported in one
animal. Neoplastic effects included reports of multiple cholangiocarcinomas in

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

389

2/10 males and a hepatocellular adenoma in 1/10 males at the 600 mg/kg bw per
day level (National Toxicology Program, 2008).
Effects in female rats were similar to those in males, but the onset and the
severity of the effects were less pronounced than in males. Survival was 100% for
all dosed groups. Statistically significant decreases in body weights were recorded
for the 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day dose groups compared with the controls. The
only consistent clinical observation occurred among high-dose animals that
appeared gaunt during the course of the study. Clinical chemistry changes were
limited mainly to the 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day groups. At 300 and 600 mg/kg
bw per day, increased levels of creatine kinase, SDH, ALT and total iron-binding
capacity were reported. Decreased serum iron was also reported at the two highest
dose levels. Additionally at 600 mg/kg bw per day, increases in creatinine, total
protein and albumin were reported. Haematological examinations revealed
decreases in erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean cell volume, mean cell
haemoglobin and reticulocytes. Increases in the number of platelets, leukocytes,
lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils were reported beginning at the 75 mg/kg
bw per day dose level. These changes were more pronounced at higher dose levels.
Organ weight changes included decreased body weights at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw
per day, increased absolute and relative (to body weight) liver weights at dose levels
of 37.5 mg/kg bw per day and higher, increased absolute and relative lung weights
at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw per day, increased thymus weights at dose levels of
75 mg/kg bw per day and higher and increased heart and right kidney weights at
600 mg/kg bw per day.
The incidences of atrophy of the gastric glands were increased in rats
administered 150 mg/kg bw per day or greater. In a special study of rats dosed with
600 mg estragole/kg bw per day for 30 days, serum gastrin concentration and
stomach pH were increased.
Histopathological examination revealed liver alterations at the 75 mg/kg bw
per day dose level in females. At the 37.5 mg/kg bw per day level, minimal bile duct
hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, eosinophilic foci and sporadic periportal
inflammation were reported. At the 75 mg/kg bw per day dose level, the same
alterations were observed with greater incidence and severity. Also, basophilic foci
were reported at this dose level. At 150 mg/kg bw per day, additional alterations
included histiocytic cell infiltrate, hepatocyte hypertrophy and mixed cell foci. At 300
and 600 mg/kg bw per day, the severity of the effects was greater. Cholangiofibrosis
was reported in one animal at 600 mg/kg bw per day. Based primarily on the
histopathological changes, a LOAEL of 37.5 mg/kg bw per day was reported for the
subchronic toxicity of estragole in male and female F344/N rats (National Toxicology
Program, 2008).
(c)

Methyl eugenol (No. 1790)

(i) Mice
Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were administered methyl
eugenol in 0.5% methylcellulose at 0 (control), 10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw
by gavage, 5 days a week, for 14 weeks. Low survival rates in males and females

390

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

were reported at the highest dose level of methyl eugenol. Mean body weight gains
of male and female mice given 300 mg/kg bw per day were significantly less than
those of the vehicle controls. There was a statistically significant increase (P < 0.05)
in liver weights in male mice dosed with 30 mg/kg bw per day and in female mice
dosed with 300 mg/kg bw per day compared with those of the respective control
groups. In the liver of male mice at the 1000 mg/kg bw per day level as well as
female mice at the 300 mg/kg bw per day and higher levels, increased incidences
of cytological alteration, necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia and subacute inflammation
were observed. A significant increase in testis weights was observed in male mice
receiving 100 or 300 mg/kg bw per day. There were no significant findings at the
10 mg/kg bw per day dose level (National Toxicology Program, 2000).
(ii) Rats
The incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms for male rats administered
600 mg estragole/kg bw per day (4/10 cholangiocarcinomas and 1/10 adenomas)
or 1000 mg methyl eugenol/kg bw per day (1/10 adenomas) by gavage, 5 days per
week, for 13 weeks suggests that total body burdens approaching 40 000 mg/kg bw
(600 mg/kg bw per day × 5 days per week × 13 weeks) are sufficient to induce a
carcinogenic response in F344 male rats (National Toxicology Program, 2000,
2008).
In a 91-day feeding study of methyl eugenol, groups of 24 male and 24
female Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on diets resulting in an average daily
intake of 18 mg/kg bw. Weekly measurements of body weight and food consumption
revealed no significant differences between test and control animals.
Haematological examinations, blood chemical determinations and urinary analysis
monitored at weeks 6 and 12 revealed normal values. At necropsy, organ weight
measurements indicated a small but significant (P < 0.05) increase in relative liver
weights for male rats only. Histopathological examination of 27 major organs and
tissues revealed no alterations that could be associated with administration of the
test material (Osborne et al., 1981).
Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344 rats were administered
microencapsulated methyl eugenol at 0 (control), 1, 5 or 50 mg/kg bw by dietary
admixture for 28 days. Clinical signs, body weight gain and food and water
consumption were monitored throughout the study. Haematology, blood chemistry
and urinalysis were evaluated for all animals at the end of the study, and urine
samples were collected weekly. Blood samples were collected at the start and at
termination of the study. At the termination of the treatment period, all animals were
sacrificed and subjected to macroscopic examination, and serum samples were
collected. No unscheduled deaths occurred during the study. No clinical signs of
toxicity were detected. No adverse effects on body weight gain, food consumption,
food efficiency or water consumption were detected. No treatment-related effects
on haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis or organ weights were observed.
Macroscopic and histopathological examination revealed no treatment-related
effects. The NOEL was therefore concluded to be 50 mg/kg bw per day (Jones,
2004).

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

391

Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344 rats were administered methyl
eugenol in 0.5% methylcellulose at 0 (control), 10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw
by gavage, 5 days a week, for 14 weeks. The final mean body weight gains of males
receiving 300 and 1000 mg/kg bw per day and of all the dosed females were
significantly (P = 0.01) less than those of the vehicle controls. Liver weights in male
rats dosed with 100 mg/kg bw per day and in female rats dosed with 300 mg/kg
bw per day were significantly higher than those of the control rats. Relative liver
weights of male rats at 30 mg/kg bw per day were increased compared with the
vehicle controls, but not with respect to the untreated controls. A significant increase
in testis weight was observed in male rats receiving 1000 mg/kg bw per day.
Haematological examination revealed a decreased mean packed red cell volume
in male rats at the 300 mg/kg bw per day level and in male and female rats at the
1000 mg/kg bw per day level. There were also increased platelet counts and
increased blood ALT and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities in male and female
rats receiving 100 mg/kg bw per day. Additionally, hypoproteinaemia,
hypoalbuminaemia and increased bile acid concentrations were evident in males
and females receiving 300 mg/kg bw per day. An increase in the incidence of
adrenal gland cortical hypertrophy and cytoplasmic alteration in the submandibular
gland occurred at the 100 mg/kg bw per day or higher levels in male and female
rats. Atrophy and chronic inflammation (chronic gastritis) of the glandular stomach
mucosa were increased in male and female rats administered 300 mg/kg bw or
greater, and there was a hepatocellular adenoma in one male rat administered
1000 mg/kg bw per day. There were no significant findings at the 30 mg/kg bw per
day dose level (National Toxicology Program, 2000).
(d)

Myristicin (No. 1791)

(i) Rats
Twelve male white rats (strain not specified) were administered 10 mg
myristicin/kg bw daily in food for 26 days. There were no differences in body weights
between the animals receiving myristicin and the controls. Histological studies of
livers and kidneys showed no abnormalities that could be attributed to myristicin
administration (Truitt et al., 1961).
(e)

Safrole (No. 1792)

(i) Rats
Groups of 10 male and female Osborne-Mendel rats were administered
safrole by oral intubation at doses of 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg bw per day for various
durations. At doses of 750 mg/kg bw per day for 19 days, 9/10 animals died; at
500 mg/kg bw per day, 1/10 animals died after 46 days; at 250 mg/kg bw per day,
no animals died within 34 days, and the following effects were observed: liver
hypertrophy with focal necrosis plus slight fibrosis, fatty infiltration (steatosis) and
bile duct proliferation, along with adrenal enlargement with fatty infiltration (Hagan
et al., 1965).

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

2.2.3 Long-term studies of toxicity and carcinogenicity
The results of long-term studies of toxicity and carcinogenicity of methoxyand methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes are summarized in Table 3.
(a)

Estragole (No. 1789)

(i) Mice
In a multipart study evaluating the carcinogenic potential of alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes, groups of 24–39 CD-1 female mice (mean weight 24 g)
were maintained on diets containing 2300 or 4600 mg estragole/kg or 2500 mg 1ƍhydroxyestragole/kg. The authors estimated that the dietary levels corresponded to
average daily intakes of 150–300 and 300–600 mg/kg bw for animals on the 2300
and 4600 mg estragole/kg diet, respectively, and 180–360 mg/kg bw for animals on
the 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole diet. To avoid intolerance, the dietary concentration was
reduced by 75% for the first 10 days and 50% for the next 10 days. The target diet
was then maintained for 12 months. Survival at 20 months was slightly lower for
estragole-fed (68–70%) animals compared with control animals (78%). The average
lifespan of mice given 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole was 13.6 months compared with 18
months in controls. Body weights measured at 1, 4 and 8 months were markedly
reduced at 4 and 8 months compared with controls. At 10 months, the incidence of
hepatomas was 58% for animals on the 2300 mg estragole/kg diet, 71% for animals
on the 4600 mg estragole/kg diet, 56% for animals on the 2500 mg 1ƍhydroxyestragole/kg diet and 0% in controls. Histopathological examinations
revealed portal fibrosis, chronic inflammation and bile duct proliferation in addition
to the tumours. Varied numbers of ceroid-laden histiocytes and focal areas of
hyperplasia and megalocytosis were also reported. Four mice fed 4600 mg
estragole/kg had hepatic angiosarcomas (Miller et al., 1983).
In another part of the study, male (55) and female (49) CD-1 mice were
administered 370 mg/kg bw of estragole by gavage twice a week for 10 doses
beginning at 4 days of age. The mice were weaned at 35 days of age. Hepatomas
in estragole-treated mice were observed as early as 11 months. At 14 months, 73%
of the males (3.5 hepatomas per mouse) and 24% of control males (0.6 hepatomas
per mouse) exhibited hepatomas. The incidence of hepatomas in females for
estragole (9%, 0.1 hepatomas per mouse) was not statistically different from that in
control females (2%, 0.02 hepatomas per mouse) (Miller et al., 1983).
Sulfate-conjugated metabolites of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole have been strongly
implicated as the major, ultimate electrophilic and carcinogenic metabolite of
estragole (section 2.1.2). Mice pretreated with pentachlorophenol, a potent SULT
inhibitor, were administered estragole or other allylbenzenes. Groups of 12-day-old
male B6C3F1 mice (18–59 animals per group) were divided into two separate
groups for each test compound. One group was given a single intraperitoneal
injection of the test compound. The other group was administered a single injection
of pentachlorophenol (0.04 mmol/kg bw) 45 min prior to administration of the test
compound. Separate groups of mice were injected with trioctanoin (vehicle) or
trioctanoin plus pentachlorophenol as controls. The first appearance of
hepatocellular carcinoma in the treated mice was at 9 months, and the experiment

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

393

was terminated at 10 months. In mice treated with estragole only, high incidences
of hepatocellular carcinoma were observed (95%, average of 6.6 hepatomas per
mouse) relative to solvent controls (17%, average of 0.2 hepatoma per mouse). In
mice administered both estragole and pentachlorophenol, the increase in
hepatocellular carcinoma (18%, average 0.2 hepatoma per mouse) relative to
solvent controls (9%, average 0.2 hepatoma per mouse) was not statistically
significant. The difference in incidence of tumours between the estragole only–
treated group and the estragole- and pentachlorophenol-treated group compared
with controls suggests that SULT activity is an important factor in the carcinogenic
potential of estragole (Wiseman et al., 1987). Inhibition of mouse liver
carcinogenicity by pentachlorophenol was previously observed for the safrole
(Boberg et al., 1983).
In another part of the study, groups of 36–40 male B6C3F1 mice were given
single intraperitoneal injections of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole at 0.1 μmol/g (15 mg/kg bw)
12 days after birth. Animals were sacrificed after 12 months, and incidences of
hepatic tumours were measured. A second group of males was given a lower dose
of 0.01 μmol/g (1.5 mg/kg bw). A statistically significant increase in the incidence of
hepatomas per mouse was observed at 0.1 μmol/g, but no significant increase was
observed at the low dose of 0.01 μmol/g (Wiseman et al., 1987).
Groups of 50 male and 50 female CD-1 mice were injected intraperitoneally
with a total dose per mouse of 9.45 μmol of estragole and estragole-2ƍ,3ƍ-oxide or
1.87 μmol of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole distributed in a ratio of 1:2:4:8 ml increasing doses
with age on postnatal days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of life, respectively. These doses
correspond to 0.63, 1.26, 2.52 and 5.04 μmol per mouse, respectively. The mice
were weaned at 22 days of age. A vehicle control group (trioctanoin) and an
untreated group were also included in the study. All mice were sacrificed at 12
months of age. Increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas were observed
for mice treated with estragole (30/46, P < 0.001) relative to the incidence for the
vehicle controls (11/42) (Miller et al., 1983).
Groups of newborn male B6C3F1 mice (50–60 per group) were given four
intraperitoneal injections of estragole, 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole or 1ƍ-hydroxy-2ƍ,3ƍdehydroestragole. The doses were administered on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of life, with
fractions of the total dose increasing with the age of the mice corresponding to the
ratio 1:2:4:12 (i.e. 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg), respectively. In the groups of mice
administered 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole and 1ƍ-hydroxy-2ƍ,3ƍ-dehydroestragole, over 50%
of the mice died within 1 week of the first injection. For these two compounds, the
experiment was repeated using doses corresponding to the ratio 0.6:2:4:12 on days
1, 8, 15 and 22, respectively. A vehicle control group (trioctanoin) and an untreated
group were also included in the study. Surviving mice were sacrificed at 18 months.
Increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (P < 0.001) were observed for
mice treated with estragole (2.4 hepatomas per mouse), 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole (5.6–
5.8 hepatomas per mouse) and 1ƍ-hydroxy-2ƍ,3ƍ-dehydroestragole (9.4 hepatomas
per mouse) relative to the incidence for the vehicle controls (0.5 hepatoma per
mouse) (Miller et al., 1983).

394

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

In a study using a hybrid strain of B6C3F1 mice and the parent strains, C3H/
He male and female mice and C57BL/6 male and female mice, the mice were
administered intraperitoneal injections of 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole on postnatal days 1,
8, 15 and 22. Dose levels were 0.1 μmol on day 1, 0.04 μmol on days 8 and 15 and
0.08 μmol on day 22 after birth. The levels are calculated to provide 11.7 mg/kg bw
on day 1, 18.8 mg/kg bw on day 8, 9.3 mg/kg bw on day 15 and 10.1 mg/kg bw on
day 22, respectively. The experiment was terminated after 14 months. The first
tumour-bearing mouse was observed at 10 months. At 12 months, 76% of the
treated C3H/He male mice (3.0 hepatomas per mouse) and 26% of control mice
(0.3 hepatoma per mouse) exhibited hepatomas. The incidence of hepatomas in
treated C3H/He female mice (6%, 0.06 hepatoma per mouse) was not statistically
different from that of control females. For C57BL/6 mice, the incidence of hepatomas
was 14% (0.3 hepatoma per mouse) in treated males and 5% (0.07 hepatoma per
mouse) in control males. No hepatomas were observed in treated or control C57BL/
6 female mice (Wiseman et al., 1987).

Methyl eugenol (No. 1790)

(i) Mice
Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were administered methyl
eugenol (99% pure) in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage daily at dose levels of 37,
75 or 150 mg/kg bw per day, 5 days per week, for 2 years. There was evidence of
hepatotoxicity of methyl eugenol in females and, to a lesser extent, in males.
Significant increases in oval cell hyperplasia, eosinophilic foci, hepatocyte
hypertrophy and necrosis, haematopoietic cell proliferation, haemosiderin
pigmentation and bile duct cysts were observed at all dose levels in male and female
mice. Non-neoplastic lesions of the glandular stomach included increases in
neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, ectasia and atrophy at all dose levels in both males
and females and mineralization and necrosis in lower incidence. In both sexes, the
incidence of chronic atrophic gastritis was high. Neuroendocrine tumours of the
glandular stomach were found in two high-dose males. The incidence of
hepatocellular adenomas, hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoblastomas was
high in both treated and control male and female mice. Whereas control males and
females showed tumour rates of 63% (31/49) and 50% (25/50), respectively, all
treatment groups of males and females had tumour rates in excess of 92%, with the
exception of high-dose males, in which the tumour rate was 82% (41/50). Infection
by Helicobacter hepaticus was documented by polymerase chain reaction–
restriction fragment length polymorphism, but associated hepatitis was not found.
Nevertheless, such infection complicates interpretation of the liver tumour findings.
In addition, liver neoplasms occur at a high and variable spontaneous incidence in
both sexes of the B6C3F1 mouse. According to National Toxicology Program (NTP)
guidelines (Haseman et al., 1984), a substance is considered to exhibit carcinogenic
potential if the highest dose is associated with an increased incidence of a common
tumour that is significant at the 1% (P < 0.01) level. While the combined incidence
of liver carcinomas and hepatoblastomas in female mice at all dose levels was
indeed significant (Poly-3 test) at the 1% (P = 0.01) level, in the low-dose (37 mg/
kg bw per day) male mice it was significant only at the 3% (P = 0.03) level, which,
according to the guidelines, cannot be considered to be statistically significant
(National Toxicology Program, 2000).

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

395

Newborn male B6C3F1 mice (50–60 per group) were given four
intraperitoneal injections of methyl eugenol and 1ƍ-hydroxymethyl eugenol. The
doses were administered on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of life, with fractions of the total
dose increasing with the age of the mice corresponding to the ratio 1:2:4:12
(i.e. 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg), respectively. A vehicle control group (trioctanoin)
and an untreated group were also included in the study. Surviving mice were
sacrificed at 18 months. Increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (P <
0.001) were observed for mice treated with methyl eugenol (3.2 hepatomas per
mouse) and 1ƍ-hydroxymethyl eugenol (3.5 hepatomas per mouse) relative to the
incidence for the vehicle controls (0.5 hepatoma per mouse) (Miller et al., 1983).
(ii) Rats
Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were administered methyl
eugenol (99% pure) in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage daily at dose levels of 37,
75 or 150 mg/kg bw per day, 5 days per week, for 2 years (National Toxicology
Program, 2000). Stop-exposure groups received doses of 300 mg/kg bw per day
for 53 weeks, followed by the vehicle only (0.5% methylcellulose) for the duration
of the study.
All males in the 150 and 300 mg/kg bw per day dose groups died before the
end of the study. Mean body weights of all dosed groups were much lower than
those of the vehicle controls throughout the study. Since the minimal toxic dose
(MTD) is defined by NTP as the dose at which there is a 10% or greater depression
in weight gain compared with controls, weight gains in animals at the 150 and 300
mg/kg bw per day dose levels were well above those at the MTD, and weight gain
at 75 mg/kg bw per day was at those at the MTD (i.e. ~10%). The incidences of nonneoplastic lesions in livers of dosed groups of males and females were increased
at 6 months, 12 months and 2 years. There were increases in oval cell hyperplasia,
hepatocyte hypertrophy and eosinophilic foci at all dose levels in male and female
rats. At the three highest doses (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg bw per day), atypical focal
bile duct hyperplasia, focal cystic degeneration and mixed cell foci were observed,
more in males than in females. Many of the same non-neoplastic lesions of the liver
were reported in the 300 mg/kg bw per day groups of male and female rats at both
6 and 12 months in the stop-exposure groups.
In males, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in control
and all dosed groups. Hepatocholangiomas and hepatocholangiocarcinomas
occurred only in the 75 (1), 150 (3) and 300 mg/kg bw per day (7) groups. Based
on the spontaneous background nature of hepatocellular adenomas and
carcinomas in male rats (14%), application of the NTP guideline (Haseman et al.,
1984) indicates that while there was a statistically significant increase in liver
tumours (56%, P < 0.01) in male rats at the MTD of 75 mg/kg bw per day, the
incidence of liver tumours at 37 mg/kg bw per day was not statistically significant
(28%, P = 0.049).
In females, liver neoplasms occurred in control and all dosed groups. In
controls and the 37 mg/kg bw per day group, adenomas were reported (1/50 and
8/50, respectively). No liver carcinomas were observed in females at the low dose.
In the 75 mg/kg bw per day group, increases (P < 0.01) in the incidences of

396

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

adenomas (11/50) and carcinomas (4/50) were reported, with an overall rate of
29% (14/49). At the two highest dose levels, the incidence of adenomas and
carcinomas was increased (34/49 at 150 mg/kg bw per day and 43/50 at 300 mg/
kg bw per day). Hepatocholangiomas and hepatocholangiocarcinomas were
reported in the 150 mg/kg bw per day females (3/49, 6%) and at higher incidence
in the 300 mg/kg bw per day stop-exposure females (17/50, 34%). The appearance
of cholangiocarcinomas and bile duct dysplasia was said to provide additional
evidence of carcinogenicity based on the rarity of these lesions in F344/N rats
(historical incidence, 3/2145, 0.1%). The absence of a statistical increase in the
incidence of liver tumours in males at 37 mg/kg bw per day and the absence of
malignant neoplasms (carcinomas) in females at 37 mg/kg bw per day do not
support the conclusion that methyl eugenol exerted carcinogenic activity at this
dose level.
Non-neoplastic lesions of the glandular stomach included statistically
significant increases in mucosal atrophy at all dose levels and neuroendocrine
hyperplasia at the three highest dose levels in females and at all dose levels in
males. Both benign (3/50, 6%) and malignant (4/50, 8%) neuroendocrine cell
neoplasms of the glandular stomach were reported in males at the 150 mg/kg bw
per day dose level and in the 300 mg/kg bw per day stop-exposure group (2/49,
4.1% benign; and 2/49, 4.1% malignant). The incidence of these neoplasms was
much higher in females at dose levels of 75 mg/kg bw per day (13/50, 26% benign;
and 12/50, 24% malignant) and greater. There was a significant increase in the
incidence of nephropathy in females at 300 mg/kg bw per day, and the incidence of
renal tubule hyperplasia was greater in the 75 mg/kg bw per day groups than in
the vehicle controls. Kidney tubule adenomas tended to be increased in male rats
as follows: control, 4/50; low dose, 6/50; mid dose, 17/50; and high dose, 13/50. In
the 300 mg/kg bw per day stop-exposure experiment, the incidence was 20/50
(P < 0.001), which was a significant increase.
There were also significant increases in the incidence of malignant
mesothelioma disseminated along the peritoneal surface of several organs in the
abdominal cavity, epididymis and testes in male rats given >150 mg/kg bw per day;
of mammary gland fibroadenoma in the 75 and 150 mg/kg bw per day males, but
without a dose–response relationship; and of fibroma of the subcutaneous tissue in
the 37 and 75 mg/kg bw per day males. These neoplasms were not found in female
rats at any dose level. The tumours (fibromas and fibroadenomas) reported in males
are common spontaneous tumours in F344 rats. Although limited historical control
incidence is cited by NTP, the rates are at least 5%.
Because of the evidence of toxicity of methyl eugenol in all groups of rats
and mice, the study cannot be recognized as conclusive for carcinogenicity at lower,
non-toxic doses. In particular, the hepatic damage undoubtedly altered the
metabolism of the compound, and the gastric damage possibly altered its
absorption.
The purpose of the NTP 2-year bioassay is to identify the carcinogenic
hazard regardless of the dose levels or route of exposure. It is not intended to be
the sole basis for a risk assessment without additional perspective provided by
studies on the relevance at human exposure levels. Based on NTP’s own criteria

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

397

for the performance of a 2-year bioassay, the identification of hazard should be
made only at levels of exposure less than the MTD. Clearly, the MTD was achieved
or exceeded at the three highest dose levels. Therefore, viewed from this
perspective, the methyl eugenol bioassay was compromised by inappropriately high
dose levels that were administered by gavage and that cause significant
hepatotoxicity, gastric damage and malnutrition in both mice and rats. Hepatic
tumours occurred in severely damaged livers, whereas the neuroendocrine tumours
of the glandular stomach were likely to have resulted from endocrine responses to
chronic gastric damage.
At dose levels of methyl eugenol at which hepatic tumours occurred in rats,
non-neoplastic liver changes, such as liver and hepatocyte enlargement, necrosis,
chronic inflammation, periportal fibrosis and nodular or adenomatoid hyperplasia,
were invariably present. Such recurrent liver damage, in particular chronic
inflammation and hyperplasia, undoubtedly altered methyl eugenol metabolism and
may have strongly enhanced the likelihood of DNA damage, fixation of relevant DNA
damage and development of initiated/preneoplastic cells to cancer. Therefore, the
hepatotoxicity induced by high dose levels of methyl eugenol most probably played
a very significant role, if not an essential one, in the formation of the hepatic tumours
in the NTP bioassay. However, if dose levels of methyl eugenol in humans are less
than those needed to induce hepatotoxicity (most probably in the range of 1–10 mg/
kg bw per day), exposure of humans to such non-hepatotoxic levels can be
assumed to be associated with a very low, possibly negligible, cancer risk. The
absence of carcinogenicity and the lack of significant liver toxicity at low doses
(25 and 5 mg/kg bw) in a 2-year dietary study with safrole (Long et al., 1963) provide
evidence that, in all likelihood, a rodent NOAEL can be established for methyl
eugenol and estragole and other alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes, most probably
at dietary levels providing an intake of 10–20 mg/kg bw per day. Since human
exposure to alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes, including methyl eugenol, from
consumption of food (0.5–1 mg/day or 0.008–0.017 mg/kg bw per day; see
Appendix 1) is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL for
hepatotoxic effects in rodents, cancer risk from alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene
(methyl eugenol) exposure can be considered to be negligibly small for humans.
Similar to the liver, neoplastic effects in the glandular stomach must be
evaluated in the context of severe gastric damage. Toxicokinetic studies revealed
rapid absorption of methyl eugenol in rats and mice, with peak plasma levels
obtained within the first 5 min (National Toxicology Program, 2000). The
bioavailability of methyl eugenol administered orally increased in a non-linear
fashion with dose, suggesting saturation of first-pass metabolism or altered
absorption and metabolism owing to gastric and hepatic damage. Introduction of a
bolus dose of test material into the glandular stomach exposes the stomach and
upper intestines to high concentrations of methyl eugenol and leads to higher peak
blood plasma levels and increased metabolic demand compared with the slower,
more steady absorption of the substance from feed. The results of NTP 2-year
bioassays and related toxicokinetic studies (Yuan et al., 1995) in which the test
material was administered by gavage and in the feed (National Toxicology Program,
1986, 1993) have clearly demonstrated that peak plasma levels are significantly
higher in gavage-dosed animals.

398

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

It has been reported for several chemicals (Poynter & Selway, 1991; Thake
et al., 1995) that chronic gastrin stimulation of the enterochromaffin-like
(neuroendocrine) cells results in the formation of neuroendocrine tumours of the
glandular stomach. Parietal cell cytotoxicity and atrophy of the fundic mucosa,
hypochlorhydria and hypergastrinaemia typically accompany the tumorigenic
response. In the case of methyl eugenol, it is likely that severe damage to the
glandular stomach resulted in achlorhydria, leading to chronic gastrinaemia, a
proliferative and ultimately carcinogenic stimulus to the gastric neuroendocrine cells
in the NTP bioassay. In a special study of rats dosed with 600 mg estragole/kg bw
per day for 30 days, serum gastrin concentration and stomach pH were increased
(National Toxicology Program, 2008). Chronic toxicity, probably related to the
toxicity of methyl eugenol, to the glandular stomach was very likely related to
anorexia and abnormal digestion and absorption, leading to malnutrition and further
organ damage and dysfunction. Gastric damage almost certainly significantly
affected the absorption, metabolism and excretion of methyl eugenol, leading to
hepatic, renal and possibly other organ damage. It is recommended that any reevaluation of the toxicity to the glandular stomach consider administration of the test
substance microencapsulated in the feed.
The increase in kidney neoplasms only in male rats may be related to the
high incidence of nephropathy and increasing severity with dose in this sex.
(c)

Safrole (No. 1792)

(i) Mice
In early studies with safrole, very high dose levels were used to induce
tumours. Hybrid 7-day-old (C57BL/6 × C3Hanf)F1 or (C57BL/6 × AKR)F1 mice
(18 males and 18 females per group) were administered safrole by stomach tube
for 21 days (total dose: 464 mg/kg bw per day), followed by dietary administration
(1112 mg/kg bw per day) for 82 weeks (total dose: 1265 mg/kg bw per day). Liver
cell tumours were found in 11/17 (65%) males and 16/16 (100%) females and in
3/17 (18%) males and 16/17 (94%) females of the two strains, respectively, versus
8/79 (11%) male and 0/87 (0%) female controls and 7/90 (8%) male and 1/82 (1%)
female controls, respectively (Borchert et al., 1973). In a 16-month study, groups of
35–40 male CD-1 mice were fed for 13 months with a diet containing 4000 or 5000
mg safrole/kg bw per day. Hepatocellular carcinomas were found in 23/87 (26%)
surviving animals compared with 7/70 (10%) in the controls (Borchert et al., 1973).
In a multipart study of the biological and enzyme histochemical changes in
the livers of safrole-dosed BALB/c mice, groups of 10 male mice maintained on diets
containing 0 or 4000 mg safrole/kg (calculated to provide an average daily intake
of 400 mg/kg bw) dissolved in corn oil were sacrificed at weeks 8, 16, 24, 36, 52
and 75. Histopathological liver alterations at 2–16 weeks included hypertrophy of
centrilobular hepatocytes, oval cell proliferation, fatty change in periportal
hepatocytes and atypical nuclei. At 24–75 weeks, foci of cellular alteration were
noted. At 36 and 52 weeks, hepatocellular adenomas occurred in 4/10 and 7/10
mice, respectively. At 75 weeks, adenomas were reported in 5/5 mice. Of the
adenomas, 0/10 tested grew upon subcutaneous transplantation into syngeneic
hosts. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed in 2/10 mice at 52 weeks and in

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

399

3/5 mice at 75 weeks. All hepatocellular carcinomas proliferated when transplanted
into syngeneic hosts. Thus, results demonstrated a sequential development of
altered hepatocyte populations leading to hepatocellular carcinomas in safroletreated mice (Lipsky et al., 1981a).
Livers of mice in the above study were weighed and subjected to enzyme
histochemistry (Lipsky et al., 1981b). At week 8, liver centrilobular tissue showed
decreased glucose-6-phosphatase and SDH activities. Foci of enzyme-altered
hepatocytes noted at 24 weeks and thereafter contained cells showing decreased
glucose-6-phosphatase and SDH activities and increased gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGT) activity. In control, iron-loaded mice, livers were intensely
siderotic. In safrole-exposed, iron-loaded mice, foci of hepatocytes resistant to iron
accumulation, varying from a few cells to a lobule in diameter, were initially noted
at 24 weeks. After 36–75 weeks of safrole treatment, hepatocellular adenomas were
noted with altered enzyme histochemical profiles. Hepatocytes from adenomas
were characterized by a decreased staining for glucose-6-phosphatase and SDH
and by increased staining for GGT and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. A few
nodules showed a decrease in staining for 5ƍ-nucleotidase. In iron-loaded mice,
hepatocytes of adenomas showed decreases in levels of stainable iron when the
surrounding parenchyma was siderotic. Hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in
livers of mice exposed to safrole for 52–75 weeks. Cells of hepatocellular
carcinomas displayed decreases in glucose-6-phosphatase and SDH activities and
increases in GGT and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. In ironloaded mice, the hepatocellular carcinoma cells were negative for stainable iron.
Foci, adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas displayed some variability in
enzyme histochemical reactions, and variability existed between lesions as well as
between cells of the same lesion.
An ultrastructural analysis was performed on safrole-induced hepatocellular
adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in mice. Adenomas were heterogeneous
in cell composition and contained dark-staining basophilic cells, pale-staining
acidophilic cells, clear cells and lipid-laden cells. Darkly staining cells resembled
fetal hepatocytes. They had large nuclei with irregular borders and limited diversity
of organelles. Rough endoplasmic reticulum was prominent and was observed as
parallel cisternae in single or double tracts, which are often associated with
mitochondria. Pale staining cells contained abundant smooth endoplasmic
reticulum. Other organelles were often displaced to perinuclear or peripheral
regions of the cell. Clear cells contained large areas of glycogen deposition. Lipidladen cells contained numerous, variably sized lipid droplets in the cytoplasm.
Hepatocellular carcinomas contained cell types similar to those of adenoma. They
contained many anaplastic cells. These resembled hepatocytes but contained
several other alterations. The cytoplasm was often filled with enlarged mitochondria
with dense or pale matrices. The cristae were sparse and had altered configurations.
Microbodies increased in number and often clustered in one region. Increases
were seen in the number of microbodies that were noted in other cells of
hepatocellular carcinomas. The results demonstrate similarities between adenomas
and hepatocellular carcinomas, but anaplastic cell types were a feature only of
carcinomas. Owing to the similarity of cell types, adenoma could be considered a
possible site of hepatocellular carcinoma development (Lipsky et al., 1981c).

400

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

In a multipart study evaluating the carcinogenic potential of alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes, groups of 24–39 CD-1 female mice (mean weight 24 g)
were maintained on diets containing 2500 or 5000 mg safrole/kg. The authors
estimated that the dietary levels corresponded to average daily intakes of safrole of
150–300 and 300–600 mg/kg bw for animals on the 2500 and 5000 mg/kg diet,
respectively. To avoid intolerance, the dietary concentration was reduced by 75%
for the first 10 days and 50% for the next 10 days. The target diet was then
maintained for 12 months. Survival at 20 months was slightly lower for safrole-fed
(53%) animals compared with control animals (78%). Body weights measured at 1,
4 and 8 months were markedly reduced at 4 and 8 months compared with controls.
At 10 months, the incidence of hepatomas was 72% for animals on the 2500 mg
safrole/kg diet and 80% for animals on the 5000 mg safrole/kg diet, and 0% in
controls. Histopathological examinations revealed portal fibrosis, chronic
inflammation and bile duct proliferation in addition to the tumours. Varied numbers
of ceroid-laden histiocytes and focal areas of hyperplasia and megalocytosis were
also reported (Miller et al., 1983).
In another part of the study, male (55) and female (49) CD-1 mice were
administered 370 mg/kg bw of safrole by gavage twice a week for 10 doses
beginning at 4 days of age. The mice were weaned at 35 days of age. For safroletreated mice, 62% of the males exhibited hepatomas (3.0 hepatomas per mouse).
The incidence of hepatomas in females for safrole (12%, 0.2 hepatoma per mouse)
was not statistically different from control females (2%, 0.02 hepatoma per
mouse) (Miller et al., 1983).
Groups of 36–40 male B6C3F1 mice were given single intraperitoneal
injections of 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole at 0.1 μmol/g (15 mg/kg bw) 12 days after birth.
Animals were sacrificed after 12 months, and incidences of hepatic tumours were
measured. A second group of males was given a lower dose of 0.01 μmol/g
(1.5 mg/kg bw). A statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatomas per
mouse was observed at 0.1 μmol 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole/g, but no significant increase
was observed at the low dose of 0.01 μmol/g (Wiseman et al., 1987).
Groups of 50 male and 50 female CD-1 mice were injected intraperitoneally
with a total dose per mouse of 9.45 μmol of safrole or its related metabolites
1ƍ-hydroxysafrole, 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide, safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-oxide and 1ƍacetoxysafrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-oxide distributed in a ratio of 1:2:4:8 ml increasing doses with
age on postnatal days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of life, respectively. These doses correspond
to 0.63, 1.26, 2.52 and 5.04 μmol per mouse, respectively. The mice were weaned
at 22 days of age. A vehicle control group (trioctanoin) and an untreated group were
also included in the study. All mice were sacrificed at 12 months of age. Increased
incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas were observed for mice treated with
safrole (32/48, P < 0.001), safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide (30/46, P < 0.001) and 1ƍhydroxysafrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide (28/51, P < 0.05), relative to the incidence for the
vehicle controls (11/42). The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas for mice
treated with 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole was greater than that for safrole, suggesting that the
1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite is the proximate carcinogen (Miller et al., 1983).

(ii) Rat
As early as 1965, long-term studies in laboratory rodents indicated that
alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes were hepatocarcinogenic when administered in
the diet, often at levels that caused liver and gastric damage. Groups (10 per sex
per dose) of male and female Osborne-Mendel rats were maintained on diets
containing 0 (control), 1000, 2500 or 5000 (25 male and 25 females) mg safrole/kg
daily for 2 years or 10 000 mg/kg for 62 weeks. The levels are calculated to provide
an average daily intake of approximately 0, 50, 125, 250 or 500 mg/kg bw,
respectively. Diets were prepared fresh weekly. Measurement of body weight
and food intake and observation of general condition were made weekly.
Haematological examinations were performed by 3, 6, 12 and 22 months and at
termination of the study. At the highest dietary level, all rats were dead at 62 weeks.
Measurement of body weight and food intake showed reduced body weight gain at
the three highest dose levels in males and females and in females provided the
50 mg/kg bw per day diet.
At the highest dose, livers were enlarged with mottling and irregular single
and multiple tumour masses. Microscopic examination revealed hepatocyte
enlargement and steatosis, nodules showing cystic necrosis, cirrhosis,
adenomatoid hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. Other
findings included atrophy and atypical regeneration of the mucosal glands of the
stomach with associated fibrosis and hyalinization of the surrounding stroma.
Atrophy of the testes was also reported. At 250 mg/kg bw per day, there was
increased mortality in males. Liver changes were of the same type and severity as
in the 500 mg/kg bw per day group. A statistically significant increase in malignant
primary hepatic tumours was reported. Other effects included a slight increase in
chronic nephritis in females and mild hyperplasia of the thyroid in both sexes. At
125 mg/kg bw per day, moderate liver damage was reported without cirrhosis or
tumours. A moderate increase in the incidence of nephritis was reported. At the
50 mg/kg bw per day level, liver damage was slight. No malignant tumours or
cirrhosis was observed (Hagan et al., 1967).
In a related study, groups of 25 male and 25 female Osborne-Mendel rats
were maintained on diets containing safrole at concentrations of 0 (control), 100,
500, 1000 or 5000 mg/kg for 2 years. The levels were calculated to provide an
average daily intake of approximately 0, 5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg bw per day,
respectively. At the highest dose, reduced body weight gain was reported in both
sexes. Haematological examinations revealed mild anaemia and leukocytosis. At
dietary levels of 100 mg/kg bw per day (approximately equivalent to a lifetime body
burden of 70 000 mg/kg bw, i.e. 100 mg/kg bw × 700 days), there was a statistically
significant increase in benign and malignant neoplasms of the liver. At the 50 mg/
kg bw day level, there was slight to moderate liver damage, but no evidence of
malignant liver neoplasms or cirrhosis. At 5 and 25 mg/kg bw per day, there was no
evidence of malignant hepatocellular carcinomas or cirrhosis after 2 years (Long
et al., 1963).

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

(iii) Dogs
Two male and two female dogs were orally administered safrole at 5 and
20 mg/kg bw per day for 6 years. No tumours were observed at either dose, but liver
changes were reported. At the higher dose, there was liver enlargement with a
nodular surface. At the lower dose, the liver changes were focal necrosis, bile duct
proliferation, fatty metamorphosis, hepatic cell atrophy and leukocytic infiltration
(Hagan et al., 1967).
(d)

Elemicin-, myristicin- and apiole-related substances and their
metabolites

(i) Mice
Newborn male B6C3F1 mice (50–60 per group) were given four
intraperitoneal injections of one of the following test compounds: elemicin, myristicin,
apiole, anethole, dill apiole (2,3-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyallylbenzene), 1ƍhydroxyelemicin and 3ƍ-hydroxyanethole. The doses were administered on days 1,
8, 15 and 22 of life, with fractions of the total dose increasing with the age of the
mice corresponding to the ratio 1:2:4:12 (i.e. 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg), respectively.
A vehicle control group (trioctanoin) and an untreated group were also included in
the study. There was no evidence of increased incidence of hepatomas for mice
treated with any of the test compounds (Miller et al., 1983).
2.2.4 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Studies of reproductive and developmental toxicity are available for a mixture
of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes present in nutmeg oil in three different species
at multiple dose levels (Morgareidge, 1972), and effects on reproductive organs
have been reported in 90-day studies on estragole in mice and rats (National
Toxicology Program, 2008).
In a study sponsored by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) (Morgareidge, 1972) that evaluated both reproductive and developmental
toxicity parameters, nutmeg oil containing a mixture of alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes (myristicin, safrole, elemicin and methyl eugenol; 10–20%) and
bicyclic terpene C10H16 hydrocarbons (Į-pinene, ȕ-pinene and sabinene; 80–90%)
was given to pregnant CD-1 mice, Wistar rats or golden hamsters.
In the mouse study, groups (20–21 per group) of pregnant female CD-1
outbred mice were given 0, 6, 26, 120 or 560 mg/kg bw of the test material (FDA
71-28) by gavage in corn oil on days 6 through 15 of gestation. A positive control
group received 150 mg aspirin/kg bw per day. Maternal body weights were recorded
on days 0, 6, 11, 15 and 17 of gestation. Females were observed daily for
appearance and behaviour. Food consumption and body weight were monitored to
eliminate any abnormalities that may be associated with anorexia in pregnant
females. On day 17, all dams were subjected to caesarean sections, and the
numbers of implantation sites, resorption sites, live fetuses and dead fetuses and
body weights of live pups were recorded. Gestation index, mortality, number of
implantation sites, number of corpora lutea, litter size and weights, sex and sex ratio

of pups, and macroscopic abnormalities in pups were reported. The urogenital tract
of each dam was examined for anatomical abnormalities. One third of fetuses of
each litter underwent detailed visceral examination at 10× magnification. The
remaining two thirds were stained with alizarin red S dye and examined for skeletal
defects.
The administration of nutmeg oil at doses up to and including 560 mg/kg bw
per day to pregnant mice on days 6 through 15 of gestation had no effects on
maternal survival, reproduction, nidation or any measured fetal parameter. The
number and types of abnormalities seen in tissues of the dam or pups of the test
groups did not differ from the number and types occurring spontaneously in the
positive or negative controls.
The rat and hamster studies used the same study protocol as that used for
the mouse study. Adult female Wistar rats or golden hamsters were individually
housed in mesh-bottom cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room.
They were mated with untreated young adult males, and observation of vaginal
sperm plugs (rats) or appearance of motile sperm in vaginal smears (hamsters) was
considered day 0 of gestation. Groups (22–23 per dose) of pregnant Wistar rats
were then given nutmeg oil at 0, 3, 12, 56 or 260 mg/kg bw by gavage in corn oil
daily on day 6 through day 15 of gestation (Morgareidge, 1972). Groups (26–28 per
dose) of pregnant hamsters were given nutmeg oil at 0, 6, 28, 130 or 600 mg/kg bw
by gavage in corn oil daily on day 6 through day 10 of gestation (Morgareidge, 1972).
In the rat and hamster studies, positive control groups received 250 mg aspirin/kg
bw per day. The administration of test article at doses up to and including 260 mg/
kg bw per day to pregnant rats on days 6 through 15 of gestation or doses up to and
including 600 mg/kg bw per day to pregnant golden hamsters on day 6 through day
10 of gestation had no effects on maternal survival, reproduction, nidation or any
measured fetal parameter.
In summary, the three species showed no evidence of reproductive toxicity
when daily dose levels of up to 260–600 mg/kg bw of the essential oil predominantly
composed of a combination of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes (10–20%) and
bicyclic terpene hydrocarbons were administered daily to mice, rats or hamsters
during gestation. These dose levels correspond to dose levels of 26–120 mg/kg bw
per day of total alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes.
In two 90-day studies performed with estragole (<99% pure) at doses up to
600 mg/kg bw by gavage 5 days per week, there were no effects on reproductive
organs of mice and rats monitored in the study (National Toxicology Program, 2008).
Given the lack of reproductive effects in the absence of significant toxicity to male
and female rats and mice, it can be concluded that the reproductive NOAEL
exceeded 75 mg/kg bw per day in mice and 37.5 mg/kg bw per day in rats, which
were the lowest doses tested.
In a developmental toxicity study with safrole, groups of 15–25 female Swiss
mice were given oral doses of safrole by gavage daily at 0, 10, 50, 100, 150 or
200 mg/kg bw per day in olive oil for 8 days from day 6 to day 14 of gestation. Males
were untreated. Pregnant females were sacrificed on day 18. Parameters monitored
included survival of females, number pregnant on day 18, number of implantations,

404

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

number and percentage of resorptions, number of live fetuses, mean fetal weight,
and number and percentage of malformations per dosed group. Malformations were
further classified according to anomalies of the cranium, anterior and posterior
phalanges, and vertebrae and morphological irregularities and absence of
sternebrae in untreated and treated groups. Fetal malformations of the palate, brain,
limbs and tail were also recorded. Survival of treated females was decreased in a
dose-dependent manner at dose levels of 100 mg/kg bw per day and above. The
number pregnant was decreased at 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg bw per day, but this
paralleled survival rates. The number of implantations also decreased at dose levels
of 100 mg/kg bw per day and above. Signs of maternal toxicity were recorded at
dose levels equal to and greater than 50 mg/kg bw per day. The percentage of
resorptions increased at doses equal to and greater than 50 mg/kg bw per day. The
mean fetal weight decreased at 50 mg/kg bw per day and above. There was no
significant difference in fetal weight and survival between the controls and the 5 mg/
kg bw per day dose group. Although there was a statistically significant (P < 0.001)
increase in malformations in the 50 and 150 mg/kg bw per day dose groups, there
was no dose–response. The authors noted that although there were significant
signs of toxicity to dams and fetuses, there was no significant increase in
malformations in the treated groups when compared with the control group. The
percentages of malformations were reported as follows: control, 9.2%; 5 mg/kg bw
per day, 13.2%; 50 mg/kg bw per day, 19.4%; 100 mg/kg bw per day, 15.2%; and
150 mg/kg bw per day, 19.4%.
The only consistent anomalies observed in treated groups were
malformations of the anterior and posterior phalanges, but there was no direct dosedependent change among treated groups. Based on these data, safrole did not
cause any increase in malformations in mouse fetuses at all administered dose
levels. Maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity were noted at doses equal to and greater
than 50 mg/kg bw per day (Moro et al., 1985). No maternal or fetal toxicity was
observed at a dose level of 10 mg/kg bw per day.
In the FDA-sponsored study discussed above (Morgareidge, 1972), female
pregnant CD-1 mice, Wistar rats and golden hamsters were given nutmeg oil
containing 10–20% alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes and 80–90% bicyclic terpene
hydrocarbons at dose levels of 560, 260 and 600 mg/kg bw, respectively, daily by
gavage during gestation. Based on clinical observations and measurement of body
weight gain, mortality and evaluation of the urogenital tract of pregnant females,
there were no signs of maternal toxicity at any dose level in any of the three species.
Based on measurements of fetal survival, fetal body weight, visceral examination
of pups and a complete skeletal examination of pups at all dose levels, there was
no evidence of developmental toxicity at any dose level in any of the three species.
Based on the lack of maternal and developmental toxicity in a teratology
study with safrole and a three-species study at multiple dose levels of nutmeg oil
containing 10–20% alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes (Morgareidge, 1972), it is
concluded that methoxy- and methylenedioxy-substituted allylbenzenes exhibit
developmental toxicity at dose levels exceeding those producing maternal toxicity
(>50 mg/kg bw per day).

Genotoxicity

2.3.1 In vitro
The literature on the genetic toxicology of the alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes estragole, methyl eugenol and safrole is fairly extensive, especially
with regard to the results of in vitro assays. The results are summarized in Table 4.
Generally, these compounds yield similar results, as might be expected based upon
their structural similarity. Moreover, given the knowledge on the two-step process
of bioactivation, positive results would be expected only in test systems that provide
appropriate bioactivation capability.
Methyl eugenol was negative in multiple tests in various strains of Salmonella
typhimurium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone and with an exogenous rat liver
metabolic activation system (S9) (Dorange et al., 1977; Sekizawa & Shibamoto,
1982; Mortelmans et al., 1986; Schiestl et al., 1989a; Brennan et al., 1996).
Estragole was also negative in common strains of S. typhimurium with and without
metabolic activation (Dorange et al., 1977; Sekizawa & Shibamoto, 1982; To et al.,
1982b; Zeiger et al., 1987; Zani et al., 1991). Safrole yielded some equivocal
genotoxicity results, but a complicating factor in evaluating the validity of positive
results is the high concentrations used, which result in cytotoxicity and false
positives. In one study (To et al., 1982b), a significant increase in the revertants per
plate was reported for strain TA1538 when incubated with safrole, estragole and
related compounds in the presence of S9 and 3ƍ-phosphoadenosine 5ƍphosphosulfate cofactor. The authors proposed that the mutagenic response was
related to the formation of an activated sulfate ester of active metabolites. Other
strains of S. typhimurium that were tested did not yield a mutagenic response in
assays using 3ƍ-phosphoadenosine 5ƍ-phosphosulfate.
No evidence of genotoxicity was found when S. typhimurium strains TA98,
TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 were exposed to 1–200 μg estragole/plate in an assay
alone or with preincubation with rat liver S9 (Zeiger et al., 1987). Results of testing
in vitro in Ames assays with estragole metabolites have yielded equivocal results.
The 2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide of estragole and 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole were positive in strains
TA100 and TA1535, but negative in TA98 with or without S13 metabolic activation
(Swanson et al., 1979). In a different study, no evidence of mutagenicity was
reported when 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole was incubated with S. typhimurium TA98 and
TA100 with and without S13 metabolic activation. Addition of 3ƍ-phosphoadenosine
5ƍ-phosphosulfate as a cofactor did not result in an increase in revertants. 1ƍAcetoxyestragole was mutagenic in strains TA98 and TA100, but not in a dosedependent manner (Drinkwater et al., 1976). Overall, estragole and its metabolites
do not appear to be mutagenic in S. typhimurium.

Negative results were reported using the Ames assay for safrole tested at
concentrations of up to 5000 μg/plate, with and without metabolic activation, in
several strains of S. typhimurium (C3076, D3052, TA92, TA97, TA98, TA100,
TA102, TA1000, TA1530, TA1531, TA1532, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA1964
and TM677) (Green, 1975; McCann et al., 1975; Dorange et al., 1977; Wislocki et
al., 1977; Green & Savage, 1978; Rosenkranz & Poirier, 1979; Simmon, 1979a;
Swanson et al., 1979; Cheh et al., 1980; Eder et al., 1980, 1982a, 1982b; Baker &
Bonin, 1981, 1985; Brooks & Dean, 1981; Garner et al., 1981; Gatehouse, 1981;
Gocke et al., 1981; Hubbard et al., 1981; Ichinotsubo et al., 1981a; MacDonald,
1981; Nagao & Takahashi, 1981; Probst et al., 1981; Richold & Jones, 1981;
Rowland & Severn, 1981; Simmon & Shepherd, 1981; Skopek et al., 1981;
Sekizawa & Shibamoto, 1982; Suter & Jaeger, 1982; To et al., 1982a, 1982b; Liber,
1985; Matsushima et al., 1985; Rexroat & Probst, 1985; Zeiger & Haworth, 1985;
Nakamura et al., 1987; Müller et al., 1993). A common observation in the majority
of these tests was the cytotoxicity of safrole at higher concentrations.
There were some reports of positive Ames assays for safrole alone and with
metabolic activation in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1530, TA1531,
TA1532, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538 and TA1964 (Anderson & Styles, 1978; Green
& Savage, 1978; Gatehouse, 1981; Trueman, 1981; Venitt & Crofton-Sleigh, 1981;
To et al., 1982a). Many of these studies did not take cytotoxicity into account in their
observations. Equivocal results were reported in one Ames study for safrole tested
at concentrations up to 2500 μg/plate in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100,
TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538 (Simmon & Shepherd, 1981). The authors of this
study noted that positive results were observed only in strain TA1535 with metabolic
activation at 500 μg/plate and above. The authors questioned this positive finding,
since the remaining four test strains provided negative results alone and with
metabolic activation. Above 500 μg/plate, increasing toxicity was observed in the
form of pinpoint colonies, which made it difficult to state whether the assay was
positive (Simmon & Shepherd, 1981).
In contrast, metabolites of safrole have shown positive results in in vitro
Ames assays. Safrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-epoxide, 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole, 1ƍ-acetoxysafrole and 1ƍoxosafrole showed genotoxic potential in S. typhimurium TA1535 in the absence of
metabolic activation. In TA100, 1ƍ-hydroxysafrole increased the number of
revertants without metabolic incorporated activation. The only safrole metabolite
that induced increased revertants in TA98 was 1ƍ-oxosafrole-2ƍ,3ƍ-oxide (Swanson
et al., 1979).
No indication of genotoxic potential for safrole was observed using the E.
coli test strains WP2 uvrA, WP2 uvrAí WP67, JC2921, JC2926, JC5519, JC5547,
JC7623, JC7689, JC8471 and JC9239 for reverse mutation and differential cell
killing assays. The majority of reports indicate no induction of mutation alone or with
metabolic activation (Fluck et al., 1976; Gatehouse, 1981; Ichinotsubo et al., 1981b;
Matsushima et al., 1981; Probst et al., 1981; Rosenkranz et al., 1981; Sekizawa &
Shibamoto, 1982; Mamber et al., 1983, 1984; Hellmer & Bolcsfoldi, 1992).
Positive results of in vitro E. coli mutagenesis assays were reported in strains
JC2921, JC5519, WP2, WP2 uvrA, W3110 and P3478 (Ichinotsubo et al., 1981b;
Mohn et al., 1981; Rosenkranz et al., 1981; Tweats, 1981; Venitt & Crofton-Sleigh,
1981). In some cases, safrole tested as weakly positive or positive only in a sampling

432

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

of the strains tested, but not unequivocally positive (Ichinotsubo et al., 1981b; Venitt
& Crofton-Sleigh, 1981). In the SOS induction assay using E. coli PQ37, uniformly
negative results were obtained with safrole (Quillardet et al., 1985; Kevekordes
et al., 1999).
Equivocal results for safrole were obtained in the Bacillus subtilis rec assay.
At concentrations up to 20 000 μg/disc, no induction of recombination was observed
(Sekizawa & Shibamoto, 1982; Suter & Jaeger, 1982). In other studies in B.
subtilis, induction of recombination was reported at concentrations of 21 000 μg/
disc and greater (Kada et al., 1980; Kada, 1981).
Equivocal results were obtained in assays with various strains of S.
cerevisiae, including D3, D5, D6, D7, D61.M, JD1, PV-3, RS9, RS112, T1, T2, C658K42 and XV185-14C, to assess the induction of mitotic aneuploidy (Simmon, 1979b;
Jagannath et al., 1981; Kassinova et al., 1981; Parry & Sharp, 1981; Sharp & Parry,
1981b; Zimmermann & Scheel, 1981; To et al., 1982a; Arni, 1985; Brooks et al.,

Zimmermann et al., 1985; Morita et al., 1989; Schiestl, 1989; Schiestl et al., 1989a,
1989b). Safrole was highly toxic to various strains of S. cerevisiae at concentrations
as low as 30 μg/ml (Zimmermann & Scheel, 1981; Arni, 1985; Zimmermann et al.,
1985; Schiestl et al., 1989a, 1989b). Positive results were often observed in studies
with modified protocols that used cytotoxic levels of safrole or that used nonstandard strains of S. cerevisiae (Kassinova et al., 1981; Mehta & von Borstel, 1981;
Parry & Sharp, 1981; Sharp & Parry, 1981a, 1981b; Ferguson, 1985; Schiestl, 1989;
Schiestl et al., 1989a, 1989b).
Forward mutation assays of safrole in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells were
predominantly negative (To et al., 1982a; Oberly et al., 1984, 1985; Lee & Webber,
1985; Myhr et al., 1985; Mitchell et al., 1988; Myhr & Caspary, 1988). Positive results
were often observed in the presence of metabolic activation (Jotz & Mitchell, 1981;
Garner & Campbell, 1985; Myhr et al., 1985; Styles et al., 1985; Mitchell et al., 1988;
Myhr & Caspary, 1988). In several of the assays where induction of forward
mutations was observed, cytotoxicity was also seen, and the mutation rate was less
than 2 times that of negative controls (Jotz & Mitchell, 1981; Myhr & Caspary, 1988).
One study reported inconclusive results based on the observations that the mutation
rate in the background was unusually high and that cytotoxicity was observed at
higher concentrations of safrole (Knaap & Langebroek, 1985).
Estragole at concentrations of 10í3–10í5 mol/l did not induce the increase of
chromosomal aberrations in V79 cells when tested alone or with metabolic
activation or in primary rat hepatocytes (Müller et al., 1994). Methyl eugenol
produced sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells,
but only in the presence of metabolic activation and at near-cytotoxic levels.
Therefore, the reported positive findings were likely due to cytotoxicity that resulted
in release of lysosomal nucleases, which may have led to a false-positive response.
Safrole concentrations of 0.01–810 μg/ml did not produce increases in SCE
in CHO cells, human peripheral lymphocytes or Chinese hamster V79 cells (Evans
& Mitchell, 1981; Natarajan & van Kesteren-van Leeuwen, 1981; Perry & Thomson,
1981; Douglas et al., 1985; Lane et al., 1985; Obe et al., 1985; van Went, 1985).

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

Increases in SCE in the presence of 0.5–810 μg safrole/ml were reported in CHO,
Chinese hamster V79 and human hepatoma strain G2 cells (Gulati et al., 1985; van
Went, 1985; Jain, 1989; Natarajan & Darroudi, 1991). In one of these studies, the
authors noted that the results, while positive, did not follow a concentrationdependent increase in SCE induction (Jain, 1989). In another study, the authors
noted that the assay was positive only at the lowest concentration, 0.1 mmol/l; at
higher concentrations, there were not enough metaphases to evaluate SCE. Mitotic
indices were reduced by as much as 80% (Natarajan & Darroudi, 1991).
In vitro micronucleus induction studies with 0.162–243 μg safrole/ml showed
mixed results. In two studies using CHO cells, no induction of micronuclei was
observed in the presence or absence of metabolic activation (Douglas et al., 1985;
Kevekordes et al., 2001). In one study using human hepatoma G2 cells, induction
of micronuclei was reported to occur in a concentration-dependent manner
(Natarajan & Darroudi, 1991).
No evidence of chromosomal aberration was observed in the majority of
reported studies for safrole at concentrations ranging from 0.16 to 300 μg/ml in CHO,
Chinese hamster fibroblast, RL1 and Chinese hamster V79 cells (Dean, 1981;
Nararajan & van Kesteren-van Leeuwen, 1981; Danford, 1985; Gulati et al., 1985;
Parry, 1985; Jain, 1989). Three studies reported the occurrence of chromosomal
aberrations when 16.2–486 μg safrole/ml was incubated with CHO, Chinese
hamster lung fibroblast and rat hepatocyte cells (Ishidate & Sofuni, 1985; Palitti et
al., 1985; Bradley et al., 1987).
UDS in hepatocytes observed following treatment of rodents with alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes is most likely produced by CYP-mediated metabolism of
the compounds to 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites. The dose–response for UDS is nonlinear, and it is therefore important to consider the dose–response relationship for
formation of the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolite.
Elemicin increased the occurrence of UDS in rat hepatocytes at
concentrations of 0.208–2083 μg/ml. The authors observed that UDS displayed
concentration-dependent increases up to 104 μg/ml (500 μmol/l). At higher
concentrations, marked cytotoxicity was observed, as manifested by increased LDH
leakage (Hasheminejad & Caldwell, 1994). In the same study, 0.192–1922 μg
myristicin/ml showed no increase in UDS levels, but the authors observed
cytotoxicity at concentrations of 192 μg/ml (0.001 mol/l) (Hasheminejad & Caldwell,
1994). A marked increase in UDS was reported when estragole at concentrations
of 10í3–10í5 mol/l was incubated with primary rat hepatocytes (Müller et al., 1994).
Freshly prepared hepatocytes from male Fischer 344 rats were incubated
with methyl eugenol, safrole and estragole at concentrations in the range from
10í6 to 10í2 mol/l (Chan & Caldwell, 1992). A significant increase in UDS, as much
as 2.7 times control values, occurred at concentrations in the range from 10í4 to
10í2 mol/l for both substrates. Cytotoxicity, as measured by leakage of cytosolic
LDH from hepatocytes, was observed at concentrations in the range from 10í4 to
10í2 mol/l. Incubation with the 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites of methyl eugenol and
estragole showed increased UDS at concentrations above 10í5 mol/l and
above 10í5–10í6 mol/l, respectively. LDH leakage occurred at 10í4 mol/l for 1ƍ-

434

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

hydroxymethyl eugenol and at 10í4–10í5 mol/l for 1ƍ-hydroxyestragole. The UDS
activity and cytotoxicity of the parent substances occurred at concentrations
approximately an order of magnitude greater than those for their corresponding
metabolites. Additionally, cytotoxicity was observed at slightly higher concentrations
than those needed to induce UDS, although the differences were minimal. A clear
non-linear relationship and threshold were established between dose for both
substances and their metabolites and UDS activity. In an earlier study, similar
results were obtained for methyl eugenol, safrole and estragole (Howes et al.,
1990a). UDS studies with 1.78–178 μg methyl eugenol/ml (10–1000 μmol/l) and
1.62–162 μg safrole/ml (10–1000 μmol/l) in rat, mouse and human hepatocytes
gave uniformly positive results; in each case, however, as the concentration of the
test material increased, the level of LDH leakage also increased, indicating cytotoxic
effects (Burkey et al., 1998, 1999, 2000; Sipes et al., 1999). In another study with
1.25–20 μg methyl eugenol/ml, the incidence of UDS was marginally increased
compared with controls but did not reach statistical significance, so it was
determined to be an equivocal result (San & Reece, 2003).
In several in vitro studies, 0.032–549 μg safrole/ml showed no increase in
UDS in rat hepatocytes, HeLa cells and human fibroblast cells (San & Stich, 1975;
Martin et al., 1978; Agrelo & Amos, 1981; Agrelo & Severn, 1981; Martin &
McDermid, 1981; Robinson & Mitchell, 1981; Klaunig et al., 1984; Probst & Hill,
1985). Safrole was shown to increase UDS in primary rat hepatocytes and HeLa
cells at concentrations of 0.000 162–1620 μg/ml (Michalopoulos et al., 1978;
Althaus et al., 1982; Williams, 1984; Barrett, 1985; Glauert et al., 1985; Martin &
Campbell, 1985; Williams et al., 1985; Howes et al., 1990b). It should be noted that
at concentrations greater than 162 μg/ml, safrole is highly cytotoxic (Burkey et al.,
2000).
2.3.2 In vivo
In an in vivo study, hepatocytes isolated 4 or 12 h after rats received a 500,
1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw dose of estragole were evaluated for UDS. Only at the high
dose were the net nuclear grain counts greater than 5 (Müller et al., 1994).
In vivo UDS studies with safrole yielded equivocal results. No increase in
UDS was observed when rats were administered 200 and 1000 mg safrole/kg bw
by corn oil gavage and the hepatocytes were isolated at 2 and 12 h (Mirsalis et al.,
1982). In a study reported with little further detail, no UDS was observed when mice
were administered up to 50% of the LD50 of safrole (Robertson, 1978). Increases in
UDS levels were observed when 640 mg safrole/kg bw was administered to mice
via intraperitoneal injection of a corn oil suspension and the mice were sacrificed
3 h post-treatment (Friedman & Staub, 1976). Similarly, when 500 and 1000 mg
safrole/kg bw were administered by single gavage dose to rats, increased UDS
levels were observed at 24, 39 and 48 h post-dosing (Uno et al., 1994). UDS levels
were increased 24 and 48 h post-administration when rats were dosed with 250,
500 or 1000 mg safrole/kg bw (Ohtsuka et al., 1998).
Given that estragole, methyl eugenol and safrole have been shown to form
DNA adducts when laboratory rodents were exposed to high dose levels, it is not
surprising that both substances and their 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites induce UDS. In

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

435

these studies, concentrations at which UDS occurs coincide with hepatocellular
cytotoxicity.
In the sex-linked recessive lethal mutation assay in Drosophila
melanogaster, 0.5–5.0 mmol safrole/l administered in the food showed no indication
of genotoxicity (Gocke et al., 1981; Valencia & Houtchens, 1981; Fujikawa et al.,
1985; Zimmering et al., 1989; Batiste-Alentorn et al., 1995; Consuegra et al., 1996).
Sex-linked lethal mutation was observed when 0.34–6.75 mmol safrole/l was
administered to D. melanogaster in the feed (Vogel, 1985; Würgler et al., 1985;
Batiste-Alentorn et al., 1994).
The majority of in vivo micronucleus induction studies produced negative
results, with one equivocal result.
Groups of Swiss mice (two per sex per dose) were administered 0, 55, 110
or 220 mg safrole/kg bw at 0 and 24 h via intraperitoneal injection. At 30 h, the
animals were killed and femoral smears prepared. No increase in micronucleated
polychromatic erythrocytes (MPEs) was reported (Gocke et al., 1981). In another
study, female C57B1/B6 hybrid mice were administered 0.36 mg safrole/kg bw (80%
of LD50) at 0 and 24 h via intraperitoneal injection, and bone marrow was harvested
at 48, 72 and 96 h. Again, there was no increase in the level of MPEs when
compared with controls (Katz et al., 1981). Groups of male ICR mice (four per dose
per sacrifice time) were administered 0, 4.11, 8.23 or 16.5 mg safrole/kg bw at 0
and 24 h via intraperitoneal injection, and femoral bone marrow was harvested at
30 and 48 h. There was no increase in the incidence of MPEs (Kirkhart, 1981).
Groups of CD-1 mice (two per sex per dose) were administered 6.5, 13 or 26 mg
safrole/kg bw via intraperitoneal injection at 0 and 24 h, and femoral bone marrow
was harvested at 30 h. The number of MPEs was comparable with control values
(Tsuchimoto & Matter, 1981). Groups of B6C3F1 mice were administered safrole
at 80% of an LD50 value (not provided) via intraperitoneal injection at 0 and 24 h,
followed by harvesting of femoral bone marrow at 48, 72 and 96 h. One very weak
positive increase in the occurrence of MPEs was reported, but this could not be
confirmed in subsequent tests in the same laboratory using the same protocol. The
authors described safrole as non-clastogenic (Salamone et al., 1981).
There was no increase in the occurrence of micronucleated normochromatic
erythrocytes in peripheral blood samples of B6C3F1 mice (10 per sex per dose)
administered 37.5, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg estragole/kg bw per day for 90 days via
corn oil gavage (National Toxicology Program, 2008).
No induction of SCEs was observed in the bone marrow of mice when
0.1–20 mg safrole/kg bw was administered via intraperitoneal injection (Paika et al.,
1981). At concentrations of 658, 888 and 1097 mg safrole/kg bw, an increase in the
occurrence of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow was observed in rats
(Sharma et al., 1982).
2.3.3 Genotoxicity conclusions
The vast majority of the assays reported for this group of agents were
conducted in the early to mid-1980s. Beginning in the late 1980s, researchers began
studying test conditions (osmolality, ionic strength, low pH) that could cause an

436

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

increase in clastogenic activity (increased chromosomal aberrations and
micronuclei) in the absence of any direct effect on DNA (Zajac-Kaye & Ts’o, 1984;
Brusick, 1986; Bradley et al., 1987; Galloway et al., 1987; Seeberg et al., 1988;
Morita et al., 1989; Scott et al., 1991). More recent research indicates that extreme
culture conditions (i.e. hypo- and hyperosmolality, high pH) induce apoptosis and
necrosis, which lead to DNA fragmentation and produce false-positive responses
in clastogenic assays (Meintieres & Marzin, 2004).
Apoptosis is a type of cell death that occurs under physiological conditions
or external stimuli (e.g. DNA-damaging agents, growth factor deprivation or receptor
triggering). The mechanism of formation of apoptotic cells includes activation of
cysteine proteases (caspases), leading to increased mitochondrial permeability,
release of cytochrome c, DNA cleavage and redistribution of phosphatidylserine to
the outer layers of the cell membrane, which enhances binding of cells to
phagocytes. DNA cleavage, owing to irreversible activation of endonucleases, is
followed by chromatin condensation and oligonucleosomal fragmentation due to
double-strand cleavage of DNA in nucleosomal linker regions (Saraste & Pulkki,
2000). During chromatin condensation, the nucleus may segregate into micronuclei.
Fragmented DNA and chromatin condensation as a result of apoptotic events are
not easily distinguished from direct action of a specific chemical.
In consideration of such information, positive evidence of chromosomal
aberrations and micronuclei must be evaluated in the context of the potential for
apoptosis and cytotoxicity to occur under test conditions. Relatively high
concentrations (i.e. up to 1923–12 315 μg/ml or 20–150 mmol/l, respectively) were
used in a study conducted by Stich et al. (1981). The Km for many enzymes involved
in cellular biotransformation processes is at or below 100 μmol/l (Bu, 2006);
accordingly, the high concentrations used in these studies may not be relevant to
the human condition, especially with respect to the levels used as flavouring agents.
No information was available on culture conditions that may have promoted
apoptosis. Results of in vitro chromosomal aberration and micronuclei assays are
difficult, if not impossible, to interpret in the absence of such information.
Given that this group of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes is highly reactive
and forms DNA adducts, it is not surprising that positive results in the standard
battery of genotoxicity tests are obtained at very high concentrations that are often
cytotoxic in vitro and hepatotoxic in vivo. Metabolic activation can be problematic,
since the typical system used in most in vitro genotoxicity studies is the Arochlor
1254–induced rat S9 fraction. Metabolites formed in this system may not be directly
comparable to those formed in the human liver. In the S9 system, CYP1A and
CYP2B isoforms are over-represented, and phase 2 metabolic enzymes are
essentially inactive, as necessary cofactors are not part of the routine assay
bioactivation system (Kirkland et al., 2007).
This group of methoxy- and methylenedioxy-allylbenzenes showed a
majority of reported negative in vivo genotoxicity results, with the exception of some
UDS assays. The induction of UDS in rodents that are exposed to high levels of the
substances is to be expected, owing to the abilities of these substances and their
1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites to form DNA adducts. At high dose levels, a metabolic shift

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

437

results in increased levels of 1ƍ-hydroxy metabolites. Additionally, the high
concentrations at which UDS has been demonstrated in these studies coincide with
those at which hepatocellular toxicity is observed. These high concentrations are
not achieved in the course of normal human exposure to these materials.

3.1

Assessment of dietary exposure

Dietary exposure to these six substances in Europe, Asia and the USA
occurs mainly by consumption of foods, principally spices and herbs, in which they
occur and by consumption of essential oils that are isolated from these foods.
Exposures to myristicin and safrole occur mainly by consumption of nutmeg, mace,
parsley, parsley seed oil and star anise. Exposure to apiole is predominantly from
consumption of the herb parsley. Exposures to the three methoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes (estragole, methyl eugenol and elemicin) also occur principally from
consumption of spices and spice oils. Exposure to estragole occurs primarily from
consumption of foods containing sweet basil, fennel and anise or their essential oils;
exposure to methyl eugenol is from nutmeg, allspice, sweet basil and fennel; and
exposure to elemicin is from nutmeg, mace, tarragon and parsley seed oil.
The range of exposure to alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes from spices and
spice oils is generally similar, with the mean exposures to safrole, myristicin,
estragole and methyl eugenol in the range of 63–166 μg/person per day. Based on
the highest reported levels of spice oil in the spice and the highest reported
concentration of the alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes in the oil, the maximum
dietary exposure levels for the same four substances are in the range of 424–569
μg/person per day in the USA. Based primarily on EU import data for nutmeg and
mace, the predicted maximum dietary exposures to safrole and myristicin are 879
and 684 μg/person per day, respectively. The predicted maximum dietary
exposures to the remaining two alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes (elemicin and
apiole) from all sources make a minor contribution to overall exposure. On the basis
of typical patterns of consumption, maximum daily exposure to each of these
substances from spices, foods and essential oils and as intentionally added flavour
ingredients does not exceed 1 mg/day (17 μg/kg bw per day). For the four alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes with the highest production volume, exposures from spice
sources normally exceed exposures from spice oil sources by at least a factor of 10.
Only estragole and methyl eugenol are used as flavouring agents, and use
is limited to the USA. Based on annual production volumes of 491 kg/year for
estragole and 77 kg/year for methyl eugenol, per capita intakes for the whole
population as flavouring agents for the USA are 5 and 0.8 μg/day, respectively.
These six alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes have been and will continue to
be consumed as a normal part of a traditional diet. They occur in highest
concentrations in spices, which are generally consumed at low levels in food.
Recent data indicating that methyl eugenol is essentially ubiquitous in samples of
human serum establish the fact that humans are regularly exposed to this substance
in the diet.

3.2

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

Evaluation of toxicological data

Most of the data in rodents indicate that at relatively high doses, several
alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes exhibit hepatocarcinogenic potential and DNA
binding in the liver. In addition, neuroendocrine tumours of the stomach were
induced by estragole and methyl eugenol. Current scientific evidence supports a
non-linear relationship between dose and the potential for carcinogenicity of these
substances. The mechanism or mechanisms by which these substances induce
cancer in animals have not been established.
The current database for rodents has a number of limitations that have an
impact on its direct application to human risk assessment, including those listed
below.
3.2.1 Interpretation of carcinogenicity data from studies in which high doses were
administered by gavage
Many of the studies of carcinogenicity after oral administration involved
gavage. Gavage administration of high doses delivered as a bolus coupled with
rapid absorption represents an acute high-level exposure of the liver, the main target
organ. For many other substances, it has been shown that dosing by gavage can
produce metabolic and toxicological effects that do not occur when the same daily
dose is given in the diet.
3.2.2 Nature of the dose–response relationship for hepatocarcinogenicity
Hepatocarcinogenicity in rodents has been reported only at high doses,
usually in excess of the MTD.
At high doses, there is a dose-dependent saturation of the principal pathways
of metabolic detoxication, leading to an increased proportion of the dose undergoing
metabolic activation of the allyl side-chain to the sulfate conjugates of 1ƍ-hydroxy
metabolites, which are the putative carcinogenic products. In addition, there is
evidence for auto-induction of CYP-mediated metabolic activation at high doses.
DNA adducts have been quantified in rodents and, in some studies, appear
to occur with a linear dose–response relationship over a wide range of doses, but
the relationship of DNA adducts to hepatocarcinogenesis has not been studied in
detail. Information is lacking on the efficiency of repair of these adducts and on the
dose–response relationship for DNA repair by either rodent or human hepatocytes.
Studies that further investigate the relationship between DNA adduct formation and
toxicity, especially bioindicators of carcinogenicity, would provide valuable
information.
Doses producing hepatotoxicity have the potential to enhance
carcinogenicity by induced liver cell regeneration, which serves to fix DNA damage
as mutations. Studies are needed to investigate bioindicators of neoplasia in
rodents, at doses below and including those that produce hepatotoxicity.

3.2.3 Non-relevance of neuroendocrine gastric tumours to humans
Rodents have high basal levels of blood gastrin and a high density of
neuroendocrine cells in the stomach glandular mucosa. With parietal cell injury and
reduced production of hydrochloric acid, gastrin levels rise markedly and stimulate
proliferation of responsive neuroendocrine cells. A variety of antisecretory drugs
produce neuroendocrine cell neoplasms in rodents, but similar responses do not
occur in humans.
3.2.4 Relevance of the toxicity data to the ingestion of spices
Data are needed to clarify whether the dose–response data in rodents for
single compounds are relevant to their presence in natural spices. Recent in vitro
data suggest that other components of natural spices might modulate the
bioactivation and/or detoxication of these substances, such that the toxicity data
relate to the use of these substances as flavouring agents but not to their presence
in natural spices.
3.2.5 Epidemiological studies on spice ingestion
Spices containing these substances have been ingested by humans for
millennia, without apparent harm. However, structured epidemiological research on
the possibility of an association between spice consumption and hepatic cancer in
humans is lacking.
4.

EVALUATION

The Committee concluded that the data reviewed on the six alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes provide evidence of toxicity and carcinogenicity to rodents
given high doses for several of these substances. A mechanistic understanding of
these effects and their implications for human risk have yet to be fully explored and
will have a significant impact on the assessment of health risks from alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes at the concentrations at which they occur in food. Further
research is needed to assess the potential risk to human health from low-level
dietary exposure to alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes present in foods and essential
oils and used as flavouring agents.

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

APPENDIX 1.

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES
IN HERBS AND SPICES

Explanation of Appendix 1
The tables in Appendix 1 for estragole, methyl eugenol, safrole, myristicin,
elemicin and apiole provide data on the content of each of these alkoxy-substituted
allylbenzenes within spices, herbs and spice and herb oils. Each table is organized
into sections, as described below.
Section 1 provides a list of the spices and herbs for which data were
compiled.
Section 2 provides the lower limit, upper limit and mean value for the volatile
oil content within each spice and herb. Data for this were collected from a variety of
sources, including internal industry data and published reports regarding essential
oil content in a variety of herbs and spices.
Section 3 provides the mean, the number of data points, and the lower and
upper limits for the content of the alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene within the volatile
oil. Data for this were also collected from a variety of sources, including internal
industry data and published reports regarding essential oil compositions.
Section 4 provides the lower limit, upper limit and mean values for the
content of each alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene within each herb/spice product.
Each value in this section was calculated by multiplying the volatile oil content (within
the herb/spice product) by the alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene content (within the
volatile oil). For instance, to calculate the lower limit for the estragole content within
basil, the lower limit for volatile oil content in basil (0.08%) is multiplied by the
estragole content within the basil volatile oil (0.01%), resulting in a lower limit for
estragole content of 0.08 mg/kg.
Section 5 provides information concerning the amount of the alkoxysubstituted allylbenzene present in each herb- or spice-derived essential oil product
that has been used as a flavouring. The first column in this section provides data
for herb- and spice-derived essential oil poundage that were collected by the Flavor
and Extract Manufacturers Association in their most recent (2005) poundage survey
(Gavin et al., 2007). Based on this reported essential oil poundage, the next three
columns provide the lower limit, upper limit and mean value for each alkoxysubstituted allylbenzene volume that would be present in each herb- and spicederived essential oil as a flavouring agent. For instance, to calculate the upper limit
for the estragole content (in kg) within the total amount of basil oil that was reported
as being used as a flavouring agent, the upper limit for estragole content in basil oil
(91.52%) is multiplied by the volume of basil oil used as a flavouring agent (828 kg).
This calculation results in an estragole volume of 757.8 kg arising from its presence
within basil oil used as a flavouring agent.
Section 6 provides information concerning the amount of the alkoxysubstituted allylbenzene present in each herb or spice product that was imported
into the USA in the 2007 calendar year. The first column in this section provides
data for herbs and spices that were collected by the United States Department of

ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED ALLYLBENZENES

461

Agriculture’s (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (http://www.fas.usda.gov/
ustrade/USTImFatus.asp?QI=). As the majority of herbs and spices that are sold in
the USA are likely imported, this column approximates the total volume of each herb
and spice that was placed into commerce in some form in the USA in the 2007
calendar year. Based on this reported volume, the next three columns provide the
lower limit, upper limit and mean value for each alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene
volume that would be present in the aggregate amounts of each herb and spice
placed in commerce in the USA. For instance, to calculate the mean limit for the
estragole content (in kg) within the total amount of basil that was reported as being
imported into the USA in the calendar year 2007, the mean limit for estragole content
in basil (1162.4 mg/kg) is multiplied by the volume of imported basil (4 398 100 kg).
This calculation results in an estragole volume of 5112.5 kg arising from its presence
within the total volume of USA-imported basil.
Section 7 provides information concerning the amount of the alkoxysubstituted allylbenzene present in each herb or spice product that has been used
as a flavouring. The first column in this section provides data for herbs and spices
that were collected by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association in their
most recent (2005) poundage survey (Gavin et al., 2007). Based on this reported
poundage, the next three columns provide the lower limit, upper limit and mean
value for each alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene volume that would be present in each
herb and spice as a flavouring agent. For instance, to calculate the lower limit for
the estragole content (in kg) within the total amount of basil that was reported as
being used as a flavouring agent, the lower limit for estragole content in basil
(0.08 mg/kg) is multiplied by the volume of basil used as a flavouring agent
(726 567 kg). This calculation results in an estragole volume of 0.1 kg arising from
its presence within basil used as a flavouring agent. These data are provided to give
an indication of how much of the total herb/spice product given in Section 5 is used
by the flavour industry. For instance, the flavour industry in the USA reported
726 567 kg of basil used as a flavouring agent, whereas the total basil imports
reported by the United States Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural
Service are 4 398 100 kg, suggesting that roughly 16.5% of imported basil is placed
into commerce as a flavouring agent. The majority of the rest is presumably placed
into commerce as a herb used as such or used for other functions (e.g. colourmodifying properties).
Section 8 provides information concerning the amount of the alkoxysubstituted allylbenzene present in each herb or spice product that has been
imported into the EU in 2004. The first column in this section provides data for herbs
and spices that were collected by the International Trade Centre for the EU for
calendar year 2004 (International Trade Centre, 2006). Based on this reported
volume, the next three columns provide the lower limit, upper limit and mean value
for each alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene volume that would be present in the
aggregate amounts of each herb and spice placed in commerce in the EU. Data on
herb and spice imports are limited and in some cases have been aggregated, which
does not allow for calculation of alkoxy-substituted allylbenzene volume in most
cases. Therefore, these data are primarily for nutmeg and in some cases for
cinnamon. For those alkoxy-substituted allylbenzenes that are not found in
quantified amounts in nutmeg, no data are reported in Appendix 1.

EXPLANATION

At its sixty-fifth meeting (Annex 1, reference 177), the Committee reviewed
a group of 40 furan-substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes,
ketones, carboxylic acids and related esters, sulfides, disulfides and ethers. The
Committee at that meeting took note of the extensive evidence for the genotoxicity
of several members of this group of flavouring agents related to furan, including the
clastogenicity of 2-furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) in mouse bone marrow. This
substance accounts for 87–96% of total exposure to this group of flavouring
agents. Noting also that furan is carcinogenic and is known to undergo epoxidation and ring opening to form a reactive 2-ene-1,4-dicarbonyl intermediate,
the Committee at its sixty-fifth meeting expressed concern that the observed
genotoxicity might be due to formation of a reactive metabolite. Few data on
genotoxicity in vivo were available, and specific assays to address potential
carcinogenicity in vivo were lacking. The Committee at its sixty-fifth meeting
therefore concluded that the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring
Agents could not be applied to this group because of the above concerns. It was
also concluded that studies of metabolism and in vivo assays for deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) reactivity, mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential of members of
this group with representative structures would assist in resolving the concerns
(Annex 1, reference 177).
Additional studies of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo with 2-furyl methyl
ketone (No. 1503) were available to the Committee at its present meeting (Durward,
2007a, 2007b; Sujita, 2007). The Committee included the new studies in its reevaluation of the group of 40 furan-substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols,
aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and related esters, sulfides, disulfides and
ethers. The structures of these 40 compounds are given in Table 1.

BIOLOGICAL DATA

2.1

Biochemical aspects

2.1.1 Hydrolysis
In general, esters are expected to be hydrolysed to the corresponding
alcohol and the corresponding carboxylic acid (see Figure 1). Like other aliphatic
esters, aliphatic esters containing furan substitution undergo hydrolysis to yield the
corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids. Furoate esters are hydrolysed to
2-furoic acid and the corresponding alcohol. Hydrolysis is catalysed by classes of
enzymes recognized as carboxylesterases or esterases (Heymann, 1980), the most
important of which are the A-esterases. In mammals, A-esterases occur in most
tissues throughout the body, but predominate in the hepatocytes (Heymann, 1980).

Hydrolysis may occur prior to gastrointestinal absorption. Concentrations
of 27 μl isoamyl furylpropanoate/l (128 μmol/l) and 40 μl ethyl furylpropionate/l
(238 μmol/l) were reported to be completely hydrolysed within 2 h by pancreatin
(Grundschober, 1977). A report that the glycine conjugate of furoic acid
(furoylglycine) was the major metabolite in the urine of rats given a 20 mg oral dose
of furfuryl diacetate is evidence that the acetal ester of furfural was hydrolysed to
acetic acid and furfural, which, in turn, was subsequently oxidized to furoic acid (Paul
et al., 1949). At the same dose level, furfuryl propionate (No. 740) was hydrolysed
to propionic acid and furfuryl alcohol, which was subsequently oxidized to furoic
acid; the methyl ester of 3-furylacrylic acid was hydrolysed to methanol and
furylacrylic acid, which was subsequently oxidized and cleaved to yield furoic acid.
It is anticipated that furfuryl and furoate esters will be hydrolysed to the parent
alcohol and acid, respectively. The parent alcohol, aldehyde and acid are expected
to participate in common pathways of metabolism and excretion.
The hydrolysis of isoamyl 3-(2-furyl)propionate (i.e. isoamyl 3-(2-furan)propionate, No. 1515) was determined in the duodenal lumen and in the portal blood
of male Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs. In an in vitro ester stability study, more than
98% of isoamyl 3-(2-furyl)propionate was hydrolysed within 1 min of incubation at
37 °C in guinea-pig blood, and no free ester was detected after 5 min. Following
injection of 30, 50 and 70 mg/l solutions of isoamyl-3-(2-furyl)propionate in saline
into the duodenal lumen just distal to an occluding ligature at 5 ml/kg body weight
(bw) and 6 ml/min, portal blood samples revealed that no free ester was detected
at 2 or 5 min. Additionally, free ester was not detected in the lumen at the end of
30 min (Pelling et al., 1980). The half-lives (t½) based on loss of the parent ester by
hydrolysis of furfuryl acetate, furfuryl propionate, furfuryl butyrate and furfuryl
isopentanoate when incubated in artificial pancreatic fluid containing pancreatin
were <0.01, <0.01, <0.01 and 5.1 ± 0.4 min, respectively (Buck, 2000). When furfuryl
propionate at 50 μmol/l was incubated with 5% rat liver homogenate, the rate of
hydrolysis (k) was reported as >70 nmol/min per milligram protein (Buck, 2000).
Furfuryl propionate was also readily hydrolysed when incubated with 5% rat blood
homogenate, at a rate of 49 nmol/min per milligram protein. Based on a single time
point, rat blood showed greater hydrolysis of furfuryl propionate when compared
with human blood (t½ = 0.0112 ± 0.0034 min, k = 0.0668 ± 0.0230 nmol/min per
milligram protein in rats versus t½ = 18.7 ± 1.9 min, k = 0.0373 ± 0.0038 nmol/min
per milligram protein in humans). Upon incubation of furfuryl propionate with
rat intestinal mucosa, rapid hydrolysis was observed (t½ = 0.0130 ± 0.0005 min,
k = 62.04 ± 0.061 nmol/min per milligram protein). Rat intestinal homogenate
showed the greatest hydrolysis activity when compared with the other tissue
homogenates used in this study (Buck, 2000).
Based on the in vitro and in vivo data, it is concluded that the esters in this
group of furan-substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones,
carboxylic acids and related esters, sulfides, disulfides and ethers are hydrolysed
to the corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids.

2.1.2 Absorption, distribution and excretion
Data on furan-substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes,
ketones, carboxylic acids and related esters, sulfides, disulfides and ethers with an
oxygenated alkyl substituent indicate that the furyl derivatives in this group are
rapidly absorbed, metabolized and excreted from animals. Furfuryl alcohol and
furfural are rapidly absorbed by rodents via common routes of exposure, including
oral (Nomeir et al., 1992), dermal and inhalation routes (Castellino et al., 1963;
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1979). At doses ranging from
0.1 to 200 mg/kg bw, furfuryl alcohol and furfural were absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract, metabolized and excreted, primarily in the urine (Rice, 1972;
Nomeir et al., 1992; Parkash & Caldwell, 1994).
More than 86% of the radiolabel from 0.275, 2.75 or 27.5 mg [14C]furfuryl
alcohol/kg bw or 0.127, 1.15 or 12.5 mg [14C]furfural/kg bw given to male Fischer
344 rats (four per group) by gavage in corn oil was rapidly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract, with 83–88% of the radioactivity being excreted in the urine
and 2–5% in the faeces (Nomeir et al., 1992). The majority of radioactivity was
excreted within the first 24 h following dosing. Approximately 7% of the 12.5 mg/kg
bw dose of furfural was exhaled as 14CO2. At 72 h following administration, residual
radioactivity was distributed primarily to the liver and kidney, with tissue radioactivity
levels being generally proportional to the dose.
More than 90% of a single oral dose of 1, 10 or 60 mg [14C]furfural/kg bw
given to male and female Fischer 344 rats or 1, 20 or 200 mg [14C]furfural/kg bw
given to male and female CD1 mice was recovered within 72 h (Parkash & Caldwell,
1994). The major route of elimination was the urine (>76% in rats and >61% in mice
within 24 h). Faecal elimination (1–6% in 72 h for all dose groups of rats and mice)
and expired carbon dioxide (5% in high-dose male mice and 4% in low-dose female
mice after 24 h; no other carbon dioxide measurements were taken) constituted
minor routes of excretion.
A similar pattern of absorption, distribution and excretion has been reported
for alkyl-substituted furfural derivatives. Groups of male Fischer F344 rats and male
B6C3F1 mice were administered 5, 10, 100 or 500 mg [14C]5-hydroxymethyl-2furfural/kg bw via gavage. In both species, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural-derived
radioactivity was rapidly cleared from all major tissues, with no evidence of
accumulation in any tissues. Tissue concentrations varied with dose in both species
at most time points. Within 48 h, 70–82% of the administered dose was excreted in
the urine of rats, whereas 8–12% was excreted in the faeces. In mice, 61–77% was
excreted in the urine and 15–26% in the faeces within the same period (Godfrey et
al., 1999).
Alkylfuran derivatives also exhibit rapid uptake, metabolism and excretion.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats administered 100 mg [14C]2-methylfuran/kg bw in
sesame oil via intraperitoneal injection showed radiolabelled 2-methylfuran (No.
1487) metabolites in the 12-h urine (Ravindranath & Boyd, 1991). It was reported
that pretreatment of the rats with buthionine sulfoximine (an inhibitor of Ȗ-glutamyl
cysteine synthetase, a key enzyme in glutathione [GSH] synthesis) at least 1.5 h
prior to [14C]2-methylfuran administration caused a 20% increase in urinary

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

491

metabolites. These data provide evidence that the urinary metabolites include GSH
conjugates. Maximal hepatic radioactivity was detected at 4 h post-administration.
Tissue distribution of 50–200 mg [14C]2-methylfuran/kg bw over 24 h showed
the presence of radiolabel from greatest to least as follows: liver > kidney > lung >
blood. The maximal amount of radiolabel was detected in the liver at 8 h postadministration, followed by a steady decline up to 24 h (Ravindranath et al., 1986).
Based on these data, the members of this group of furan-substituted aliphatic
hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and related esters,
sulfides, disulfides and ethers are rapidly absorbed, distributed through key organs
involved in metabolic processes and then eliminated, primarily in the urine.
2.1.3 Metabolism
The biotransformation processes that act on this group of furan-substituted
flavouring agents are, in large part, dependent on the presence or absence of
specific functional groups on the aliphatic side-chain. The substances in this group
are metabolized to polar products that are mainly conjugated and then excreted in
the urine (see Figure 2).
(a)

Alkyl-substituted furan (Nos 1487–1496) and furyl ketone (Nos 1503–
1512) derivatives

Alkyl-substituted furan and benzofuran derivatives undergo cytochrome
P450 (CYP)–induced side-chain oxidation to yield an alcohol functional group
located at the position bonded directly to the furan ring. The resulting alcohol may
be excreted in the urine primarily as the glucuronic acid or sulfate conjugate, or it
may be converted to the corresponding ketone, which may also be excreted in the
urine. CYP-induced side-chain oxidation, preferably at the C1ƍ position of furan, is
similar to that observed with other alkyl-substituted heterocyclic derivatives (e.g.
pyridine derivatives) (Hawksworth & Scheline, 1975; Ruangyuttikarn et al., 1992;
Thornton-Manning et al., 1993; Gillam et al., 2000). In addition to side-chain
oxidation, the furan ring may undergo CYP-mediated oxidation (epoxidation) to yield
unstable epoxides that may ring-open to yield reactive 2-enedial intermediates.
These types of intermediates have been shown to readily conjugate with GSH,
depleting free GSH and subsequently, at high levels, forming protein and DNA
adducts (Ravindranath et al., 1983, 1984, 1986; Ravindranath & Boyd, 1985).
The metabolic fate of a 2-ethylbenzofuran derivative has been investigated
in humans, rats and dogs. Two healthy male subjects were each given an oral 100
mg dose of [3-14C]benzarone [3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) 2-ethylbenzofuran] in two
gelatin capsules. Approximately 73% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine
over 5 days, with more than 59% being excreted in the first 24 h. Approximately
19% of the radioactivity was excreted in the faeces over 5 days. The principal
metabolites included benzarone hydroxylated at the C1ƍ position of the furan ring
and a glucuronic acid conjugate either of the C1ƍ hydroxyl or the phenolic hydroxyl
group. In the dog or rat, more than 80% of a 0.5 or 2 mg/kg bw dose of [3-14C]benzarone was excreted in the faeces during the first 48 h. In the rat or dog, most

(>70%) of the absorbed dose was eliminated by direct conjugation of the
administered substance, whereas in humans, >70% was hydroxylated before
conjugation. The authors speculated that the benzarone glucuronic acid conjugate
was excreted directly into the bile more readily in rats and dogs than in humans,
thereby minimizing further hydroxylation in the liver (Wood et al., 1987).
Two healthy male volunteers were administered a single oral daily dose of
100 mg benzbromarone [(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) (2-ethyl-3-benzofuranyl)
methanone] for 8 consecutive days (DeVries et al., 1993). The major metabolites were formed by C1ƍ-hydroxylation to yield the corresponding
1ƍ-hydroxybenzbromarone and by hydroxylation of the benzene side-chain to yield
6-hydroxybenzbromarone. The corresponding C1ƍ ketone formed by oxidation of the
1ƍ-hydroxy group was also identified in the urine. The ratio of C1ƍ enantiomers of

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

493

1ƍ-hydroxybenzbromarone was 2.12 in the plasma and 7.32 in the urine. These
metabolic data support the conclusion that alkyl-substituted furan and benzofuran
derivatives undergo side-chain oxidation to yield the corresponding alcohol
metabolite, which can be excreted as the glucuronic acid conjugate or oxidized to
the corresponding ketone, followed by excretion in the urine.
Unsubstituted and short-chain alkyl-substituted furans have also been
shown to undergo ring epoxidation in the liver by mixed-function oxidases. Epoxysubstituted furans have been reported to undergo ring opening to yield reactive 2ene-1,4-dicarbonyl intermediates (see example in Figure 2) that can be conjugated
with GSH and readily eliminated in the urine or, at relatively high concentrations,
react with proteins and DNA to form adducts.
Initial in vitro experiments in rat microsomal preparations suggested that high
concentrations of alkyl-substituted furans are partly metabolized to reactive
acetylacrolein1-type intermediates (Ravindranath et al., 1983, 1984). Acetylacrolein
is a potent microsomal mixed-function oxidase inhibitor that has been reported to
bond covalently and irreversibly to the oxidizing enzyme, thus inactivating it
(Ravindranath & Boyd, 1985).
Significant protein binding (>55 nmol/mg protein) was reported when 10
mmol [14C]2-methylfuran/l was incubated with rat hepatic microsomes in the
presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and
oxygen (Ravindranath & Boyd, 1985). In the absence of oxygen or NADPH, little
binding was observed (<2 nmol/mg protein). These data suggest that NADPHdependent oxidation of 2-methylfuran is a prerequisite for protein binding. Increased
protein binding (>80 nmol/mg protein) was also reported when Sprague-Dawley rats
were pretreated with phenobarbital, a CYP inducer, whereas decreased or no
protein binding was observed in the presence of piperonyl butoxide and N-octyl
imidazole, both of which are inhibitors of CYPs. The maximum rate (Vmax) and
Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for 2-methylfuran metabolism in phenobarbitalpretreated rats were 0.81 μmol/2 mg microsomal protein per minute and
0.463 mmol/l, respectively; in rats without phenobarbital pretreatment, they were
0.53 μmol/2 mg microsomal protein per minute and 1.417 mmol/l, respectively.
These data suggest that 2-methylfuran undergoes CYP-mediated oxidation to yield
a reactive metabolite (i.e. acetylacrolein) that binds covalently to protein.
In the same study, when acetylacrolein at 0.25 mmol/l (24.5 μg/ml) was
added to the incubation mixture, microsomal metabolism of 2-methylfuran was
almost completely inhibited (covalent binding was 1.5% of the control incubation).
At a concentration of 0.5 mmol acetylacrolein/l (49.1 μg/ml), no metabolism of
2-methylfuran was detectable, suggesting that acetylacrolein inhibits CYPmediated oxidation, probably through direct covalent bonding with the enzyme.
Thus, 2-methylfuran is a suicide substrate for CYP. Conjugation of the reactive

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

metabolite with sulfhydryl trapping agents, including cysteine (10 mmol/l) and GSH
(10 mmol/l), showed a marked decrease in microsomal protein binding, suggesting
that sulfhydryl conjugation plays a role in the detoxication of acetylacrolein. Cysteine
was the better trapping agent for the prevention of microsomal protein binding when
compared with GSH, semi-carbazide, lysine or N-acetylcysteine. The authors
postulated that cysteine forms a stable cyclic conjugate with Į,ȕ-unsaturated
aldehydes, whereas the ability of GSH to form stable conjugates with Į,ȕunsaturated aldehydes varies (Esterbauer et al., 1975, 1976; Ravindranath &
Boyd, 1985).
Other in vitro experiments support the conclusion that CYP-mediated
oxidation of 2-methylfuran is directly related to its toxicity. This was studied in
hepatocytes isolated from adult male Wistar rats that were untreated or treated with
phenobarbitone (0.1% in drinking-water for 5 days) or ȕ-naphthoflavone (80 mg/kg
bw by intraperitoneal injection daily for 3 days). The cultured hepatocytes were
incubated with 2-methylfuran at 0, 100, 300, 600 or 1000 μmol/l (0, 8.2, 24.6, 49.3
and 82.1 μg/ml, respectively) for 24 h. The median lethal concentrations (LC50
values) for untreated, phenobarbitone-treated or ȕ-naphthoflavone-treated
hepatocytes were 794, 34 and 57 μmol/l (65.2, 2.8 and 4.7 μg/ml), respectively,
indicating that enzyme induction increased the toxicity of 2-methylfuran (Hammond
& Fry, 1991).
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were administered a single dose of
50, 100, 200 or 400 mg 2-methylfuran/kg bw in sesame oil by intraperitoneal
injection and were sacrificed 24 h later. The 50 mg/kg bw group did not show any
evidence of liver necrosis, but they exhibited endothelial injury, with bleeding of the
endothelium into the vascular lumen of the central veins. Animals given 100, 200 or
400 mg 2-methylfuran/kg bw showed a dose-related increase in the severity of
hepatocellular injury (e.g. eosinophilic cytoplasm, vacuolation), centrilobular
necrosis, and necrosis and sloughing of the bronchiolar epithelium, which, at the
high dose, resulted in complete obliteration of numerous respiratory and terminal
bronchioles. Dose-related increases in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT)
were observed up to 200 mg 2-methylfuran/kg bw; however, the levels of serum
GPT in the animals given 50 mg 2-methylfuran/kg bw were not significantly higher
than those of the control rats. At a dose of 100 mg/kg bw, GSH levels in liver were
reduced by 32% at 0.5 h and 20% at 4 h. Depletion was not found in the lungs.
Tissue distribution and covalent binding studies were conducted over a period of
0.5–24 h after an intraperitoneal dose of 100 mg [14C]2-methylfuran/kg bw. Maximal
covalent binding was observed in the liver at 4 h. At all time points, binding of the
label was greatest in liver, followed by kidney (Ravindranath et al., 1986).
Free GSH levels in the liver, lungs and kidneys, investigated over a period
of 0.5–36 h after administration of 100 mg 2-methylfuran/kg bw, were initially
decreased (67.5% of control in the liver and 87% of control in the kidneys at 0.5 h),
but then reached or exceeded control levels within 8–24 h (137% of control in the
kidneys and 130% of control in the lungs at 12 h). The radiolabelled [14C]2methylfuran covalently bound to protein was detected at the highest concentration
in the liver, followed by the kidney, lung and blood. Liver and kidney DNA also
showed covalent binding of 14C label, with a 2-fold increase in binding in the liver

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

495

with phenobarbital pretreatment. Conversely, N-octylimidazole pretreatment
decreased the level of covalent binding of the 14C label to proteins and DNA in the
liver, lung and kidney. Increased and decreased protein binding and hepatotoxicity
measured as serum GPT levels were observed in rats pretreated with phenobarbital
and N-octylimidazole, respectively. 3-Methylcholanthrene or piperonyl butoxide
pretreatment did not affect either covalent binding or hepatotoxicity. These results
provide evidence that bioactivation of 2-methylfuran by a CYP system is a
prerequisite for tissue necrosis in rats (Ravindranath et al., 1986).
In a study examining GSH and cysteine conjugation on the toxic potential
of 2-methylfuran, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated subcutaneously with a
900 mg/kg bw dose of buthionine sulfoximine 1.5 h prior to intraperitoneal
administration of 100 mg [14C]2-methylfuran/kg bw prepared in sesame oil. Marked
decreases in covalent DNA and protein binding in the liver and reduced
hepatotoxicity, as indicated by lower serum GPT levels, were observed. Buthionine
sulfoximine treatment revealed a transient increase in plasma cysteine levels,
concurrent with a decrease in GSH levels. However, administration of 100 mg
2-methylfuran/kg bw 1.5 h after buthionine sulfoximine administration significantly
reduced plasma cysteine levels and increased (20%) urinary elimination of
2-methylfuran-labelled metabolites compared with the control group ([14C]2methylfuran only). Subcutaneous pretreatment with diethylmaleate, a depletor of
liver GSH, at 0.4 ml/kg bw increased binding to liver proteins and increased
hepatotoxicity, as indicated by a rise in serum GPT levels compared with rats that
received only 2-methylfuran. Subcutaneous pretreatment of rats with GSH
synthesis promoter L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate at a dose of 1000 mg/kg bw
resulted in a marked increase of covalent protein binding in the liver and potentiated
hepatotoxicity (increased serum GPT levels compared with rats that received only
2-methylfuran). When rats were pretreated with both buthionine sulfoximine and
L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate, a marked decrease in covalent protein binding
in the liver and hepatotoxicity, as indicated by a reduction in serum GPT levels, was
observed. No unchanged 2-methylfuran was observed in the urine, indicating that
pretreatment did not inhibit metabolic processes (Ravindranath & Boyd, 1991). The
authors proposed that buthionine sulfoximine pretreatment indirectly aids in the
detoxication of 2-methylfuran through a reduction of GSH supply and an increase
in the availability of cysteine, which forms a more stable conjugate with
acetylacrolein (Esterbauer et al., 1976; Ravindranath & Boyd, 1991).
Adult male Swiss albino mice (10–15 per group) were administered
2-ethylfuran (commercial grade, No. 1489) at 200 mg/kg bw in sesame oil via
intraperitoneal injection with or without phenobarbital, piperonyl butoxide or
cobalt(II) chloride pretreatment. The mortality rates were 1/10, 2/10, 3/15 and 2/11
for the untreated, phenobarbital pretreatment, piperonyl butoxide pretreatment and
cobalt(II) chloride pretreatment groups, respectively. 2-Ethylfuran produced a
moderate necrosis of the liver and mild to moderate necrosis of the kidneys. The
kidney necrosis was described as a coagulative lesion of the proximal convoluted
tubules of the outer cortex, without damage to the glomerular or medullary cells.
Piperonyl butoxide and cobalt(II) chloride decreased the severity of necrosis in the
liver and kidney (McMurtry & Mitchell, 1977).

496

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

In the same study, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 70 mg 2acetylfuran (commercial grade)/kg bw in 0.9% sodium chloride, with and without
phenobarbital pretreatment, and 80 mg 2-acetylfuran/kg bw, with and without
cobalt(II) chloride pretreatment. The mortality rates were 1/12, 0/12, 0/12 and 0/12
for the 70 mg 2-acetylfuran/kg bw, 70 mg 2-acetylfuran/kg bw plus phenobarbital,
80 mg 2-acetylfuran/kg bw, and 80 mg 2-acetylfuran/kg bw plus cobalt(II) chloride
treatment groups, respectively. Mice treated with 2-acetylfuran showed no evidence
of toxicity in the kidneys. Hepatic necrosis, described as midzonal-centrilobular
necrosis of the parenchymal hepatocytes, was mild in severity with cobalt(II)
chloride pretreatment, showing a marked decrease in the incidence and severity of
necrosis.
Ten male ICR mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2-ethylfuran
(analytical reagent grade) at 2.6 mmol/kg bw (250 mg/kg bw) in sesame oil.
Histopathology of tissues collected 24 h later revealed extensive proximal tubular
necrosis of the kidneys and focal hydroptic degeneration of the liver. Significant
increases in the plasma urea nitrogen level (approximately 5 times control level)
and GPT level were reported (Wiley et al., 1984).
Severe bronchiolar necrosis was reported when 2-ethylfuran (2.6 mmol/kg
bw or 250 mg/kg bw) in sesame oil was administered by intraperitoneal injection to
male ICR mice. Administration of 1.56 mmol 2-ethylfuran/kg bw (150 mg/kg bw) via
intraperitoneal injection to five male ICR mice showed approximately a doubling,
compared with control values, of the amount of [14C]thymidine incorporation into
pulmonary DNA measured at 3 days after dosing, which indicates cell replication
and lung repair (Gammal et al., 1984).
In a study of the tumour-inhibiting properties of 2-heptylfuran (No. 1492),
increased cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity was observed in tissue
preparations of the liver, forestomach and small bowel mucosa isolated from 7week-old female A/J mice (five mice per group) that received doses of 12, 25, 50 or
80 μmol of 2-heptylfuran dissolved in cottonseed oil via gavage every other day for
a total of three doses. A 50 μmol dose of 2-heptylfuran showed a significant increase
in acid-soluble sulfhydryl levels, which is a good measure of GSH content in tissues,
in all four tissue types (liver, small bowel mucosa, forestomach and lung) when
compared with controls (Lam & Zheng, 1992).
The neurotoxic potential of 2,5-dimethylfuran (No. 1488) and a series of
hexane derivatives was evaluated using freshly prepared Schwann cells isolated
from the sciatic nerves of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats that were incubated with
0.17, 0.33, 0.67, 1.33, 2.66, 5.33, 10.7 or 21.3 mmol 2,5-dimethylfuran/l (16.3, 31.7,
64.4, 127.9, 255.7, 512.4, 1028.6 and 2047.6 μg/ml, respectively) (Kamijima et al.,
1996). Compared with other hexane derivatives, dimethylfuran exhibited a high
potential to inhibit the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into Schwann cell DNA, as
indicated by its low median effective concentration (EC50 value). Concentrations of
2,5-dimethylfuran of 5.33 mmol/l (512.4 μg/ml) and above induced cytotoxic
changes in Schwann cell morphology, including a loss of cell processes, rounding
of cell shape and detachment from the substratum. At concentrations of 5.33 mmol/
l (512.4 μg/ml) and above, 2,5-dimethylfuran completely inhibited the Schwann

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

497

cells’ ability to incorporate [3H]thymidine. The cytotoxicity of 2,5-dimethylfuran was
not mediated by dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a known
Schwann cell mitogen. The authors proposed that cytotoxicity occurred through a
suppression of DNA synthesis, which is related to oxidative stress induced by
2,5-dimethylfuran.
Administration of 2,5-dimethylfuran in the drinking-water at a concentration
of 0.25–1.0% (approximately 250–1000 mg/kg bw; Food and Drug Administration,
1993) or via gavage at dose levels of 200–1200 mg/kg bw to male rats produced
no neurotoxic effects (Krasavage et al., 1978). No further discussion or details were
reported in this abstract.
In summary, alkyl-substituted furans can be metabolized by side-chain
oxidation to initially yield the 1ƍ-alcohol derivative, which can be either conjugated
and excreted or oxidized to the corresponding ketone. The conversion to the ketone
is anticipated to be reversible, in which case the ketones are reduced to the
corresponding alcohols and excreted mainly in the urine. In a second pathway, the
furan ring can be oxidized to form an unstable epoxide that may undergo rapid ring
opening to yield reactive 2-ene-1,4-dicarbonyl intermediates (e.g. acetylacrolein).
The reactive intermediate can be conjugated with available sulfhydryl trapping
agents, such as GSH and cysteine, or, at high in vivo concentrations, can be
covalently bound to proteins and DNA.
(b)

Furan-substituted aldehydes, carboxylic acids and related esters
(Nos 1497–1502 and 1513–1519)

The aldehydes in this group are alkyl- or aryl-substituted 3-furyl-2-propenal
(Nos 1497–1499, 1501 and 1502) or 3-furyl-2-propanal (No. 1500) derivatives. As
such, they are readily oxidized to the corresponding 3-furylpropenoic acid or 3furylpropanoic acid derivatives. As noted above, the esters in the group are
hydrolysed to yield 3-furylpropanoic acid (Nos 1513–1516) or 3-furylpropenoic acid
(No. 1518), whereas one furoate ester is hydrolysed to furoic acid. The Committee
has previously reviewed the metabolic fate of furoic acid and 3-furylpropenoic acid
(Annex 1, references 160 and 150, respectively). Both are readily excreted by
humans and other animals in the urine primarily as glycine conjugates. In the major
metabolic detoxication pathway for furfuryl alcohol, furfural and furoic acid, the
coenzyme A (CoA) thioester of furoic acid is either conjugated with glycine and
excreted in the urine or condensed with acetyl-CoA to form the CoA thioester of 2furanacrylic acid (3-furylpropenoic acid). This compound, 2-furanacryloyl CoA, is
also conjugated with glycine and excreted primarily in the urine (Nomeir et al., 1992;
Parkash & Caldwell, 1994).
The condensation of furoic acid with acetyl-CoA to yield furanacrylic acid
(3-furylpropenoic acid) appears to be a dynamic equilibrium favouring the CoA
thioester of furoic acid (Parkash & Caldwell, 1994). The observation that furoic acid
was excreted in the urine of dogs given furanacrylic acid is evidence for this
equilibrium (Friedmann, 1911). An analogous equilibrium is established between
other aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g. benzoic acid and cinnamic acid) (Nutley et al.,
1994). Excretion of free furoic acid and furanacrylic acid at higher dose levels in

498

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

animals suggests that glycine conjugation may be capacity limited, probably by the
supply of endogenous glycine (Gregus et al., 1993).
It is anticipated that the aldehydes in this group will be oxidized to the
corresponding 3-furylpropenoic acid or 3-furylpropanoic acid derivatives. The esters
in this group will be hydrolysed to the same 3-furylpropenoic acid or 3-furylpropanoic
derivatives. The acids will then be conjugated with glycine and excreted. Similarly,
furoic acid formed by ester hydrolysis will be conjugated with glycine and excreted
in the urine.
(c)

Furan-substituted ethers (Nos 1520–1522)

The Committee has previously reviewed the metabolic fate of alkylsubstituted aromatic ethers (Annex 1, references 166 and 167). If the substance is
a methyl (No. 1520) or ethyl (No. 1521) furfuryl ether, O-dealkylation occurs in vivo
to yield the furfuryl alcohol, which subsequently undergoes oxidation to furoic acid.
As discussed above, furoic acid conjugates with glycine and is excreted mainly in
the urine. Difurfuryl ether (No. 1522) is anticipated to undergo CYP-catalysed
hydroxylation to yield the hemiacetal, which readily hydrolyses to yield furfuryl
alcohol and furfural. Both of these substances are then oxidized to furoic acid and
excreted (Nomeir et al., 1992; Parkash & Caldwell, 1994).
(d)

Furan-substituted sulfides, disulfides and thioesters
(Nos 1523–1526)

The Committee has previously reviewed the metabolic fate of furansubstituted sulfides and disulfides (Annex 1, references 160 and 161).
The two thioesters (Nos 1523 and 1526) in the group are anticipated to
undergo hydrolysis to the corresponding thiol (2,5-dimethyl-3-thiofuran, No. 1063)
and furfuryl mercaptan (No. 1072) and simple aliphatic carboxylic acid. The resulting
thiols are highly reactive in vivo, mainly because most thiols are readily oxidized.
Thiols are oxidized to unstable sulfenic acids (RSOH), which are further oxidized to
the corresponding sulfinic (RSO2H) and sulfonic acids (RSO3H). Methylation of
thiols primarily by S-adenosyl methionine yields methyl sulfides, which are then
readily oxidized to sulfoxides and sulfones. Thiols may react with physiological thiols
to form mixed disulfides or form conjugates with glucuronic acid. Oxidation of the
Į-carbon results in desulfuration and formation of an aldehyde, which oxidizes to
the corresponding acid (McBain & Menn, 1969; Dutton & Illing, 1972; Maiorino et
al., 1989; Richardson et al., 1991).
The labile nature of the S–S bond in furfuryl 2-methyl-3-furyl disulfide
(No. 1524) also presents a variety of metabolic options for detoxication. The
disulfide bond is rapidly reduced to the corresponding thiol (i.e. mercaptan) in a
reversible reaction in vivo. Therefore, the metabolic options available to thiols are
also available to disulfides. Thiol–disulfide exchange reactions are reversible,
nucleophilic substitution reactions that occur in vivo between low relative molecular
mass reduced and/or oxidized thiols (e.g. GSH disulfide or GSH) and cysteinyl thiol
components of proteins, resulting in the formation of mixed disulfides. The disulfide

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

499

bonds in mixed disulfides may undergo reduction, releasing the thiol from the protein
(Brigelius, 1985; Sies et al., 1987; Cotgreave et al., 1989).
The remaining substance is a sulfide (No. 1525). Monosulfides are expected
to undergo oxidation, mainly to the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone. Sulfoxides
and sulfones are physiologically stable and are excreted unchanged in the urine
(McBain & Menn, 1969; Nickson & Mitchell, 1994; Nickson et al., 1995; Nnane &
Damani, 1995).
(e)

Furan metabolism and mechanism of action

The biotransformation processes that can act upon this group of furansubstituted flavouring agents are, in large part, dependent on the presence or
absence of specific functional groups on the aliphatic side-chain. The substances
in this group are metabolized to polar products that are mainly conjugated and
then excreted in the urine. At higher dose levels, low relative molecular mass
alkyl furans (e.g. 2-methylfuran) can undergo ring oxidation to yield reactive
2-ene-1,4-dicarbonyl intermediates, which can, subsequently, be conjugated with
sulfhydryl trapping agents or react with protein and DNA. The most extreme
example of this is furan, which has limited metabolic options available and primarily
metabolizes via the ring oxidation mechanism to produce an enedialdehyde species
that is a potent hepatotoxin.
In standard Salmonella mutagenicity assays in vitro, furan did not induce
gene mutations in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, either
with or without S9 metabolic activation, at concentrations up to 3333 μg/plate
(Mortelmans et al., 1986). Furan was reported to give positive results in sister
chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster
ovary cells, with and without S9 (National Toxicology Program, 1991). Furan also
was reported to give positive results in trifluorothymidine resistance assays in
cultured mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells (McGregor et al., 1988). The average
mutation frequencies recorded in these experiments increased with increasing
concentrations of furan. However, furan cytotoxic effects, which were assessed by
measuring relative total growth in comparison with vehicle controls, were also
significant at the doses at which positive mouse lymphoma results were recorded.
In in vitro micronucleus assays in human lymphocytes, furan concentrations from 0
to 100 mmol/l either with or without rat liver S9 metabolic activation gave no increase
in the frequency of micronucleated cells (Durling et al., 2007).
In in vivo experiments, furan administered to male B6C3F1 mice by
intraperitoneal injection induced chromosomal aberrations but not sister chromatid
exchanges in bone marrow cells (National Toxicology Program, 1991). In germ cells
of male Drosophila melanogaster, furan did not produce sex-linked recessive
lethal mutations when administered either by feeding or by injection (Foureman et
al., 1994). In in vivo micronucleus experiments, furan was administered to male
BALB/c mice (intraperitoneally at 0–300 mg/kg bw or by subcutaneous injection at
0–275 mg/kg bw) and to male CBA mice (intraperitoneally at 0 and 225 mg/kg bw).
No increased level of micronucleated erythrocytes was detected in any of the
micronucleus assays (Durling et al., 2007).

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

Furan has been studied in standard 2-year bioassays (National Toxicology
Program, 1991). Groups of Fischer 344 rats (70 per sex) were administered 2, 4 or
8 mg furan/kg bw by gavage in corn oil 5 days per week for 2 years. After treatment
for 9 and 15 months, 10 rats from each group were evaluated for the presence of
treatment-associated lesions. The strongest treatment-related effects were
observed in the liver. In all treated groups, cholangiocarcinoma of the liver was
observed and was present in many rats of each sex at the 9- and 15-month interim
evaluations. Incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined)
were significantly increased in male rats after 2 years of furan exposure, and
hepatocellular adenomas were significantly increased in female rats. Nonneoplastic liver lesions, including biliary tract fibrosis, hyperplasia, chronic
inflammation, proliferation and hepatocyte cytomegaly, cytoplasmic vacuolization,
degeneration, nodular hyperplasia and necrosis were abundant in all rats
administered furan. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukaemia were increased in
male and female rats that received 4 or 8 mg furan/kg bw, and the incidence in the
8 mg/kg bw groups of each sex exceeded the historical control ranges for corn oil
gavage studies.
In 2-year bioassays in mice, groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex received
doses of 8 or 15 mg furan/kg bw 5 days per week for 2 years (National Toxicology
Program, 1991). As with the rat studies, the strongest treatment-related effects were
observed in the liver. The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas
were significantly increased in mice receiving treatment. The incidences of
numerous non-neoplastic hepatocellular lesions were increased in dosed mice.
These lesions included hepatocyte cytomegaly, degeneration, necrosis, multifocal
hyperplasia, cytoplasmic vacuolization and biliary tract dilatation, fibrosis,
hyperplasia and inflammation.
Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there was clear evidence of carcinogenic
activity of furan in male and female Fischer 344/N rats based on increased
incidences of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and on
increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukaemia. There was also clear evidence
of carcinogenic activity of furan in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on
increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and benign
phaeochromocytomas of the adrenal gland.
The furan hepatocarcinogenicity demonstrated in the NTP 2-year bioassays
has been studied and interpreted as proceeding through a mechanism that is
secondary to the potent hepatotoxicity of furan. Furan has limited metabolic options
available and is primarily transformed via cytochrome P450 catalysis to a reactive
metabolite, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial. The high concentrations of furan that were
administered in the 2-year bioassays led to high levels of cis-2-butene-1,4-dial, and
this enedialdehyde reacts in a non-enzymatic reaction with cellular proteins and with
glutathione, leading to uncoupling of hepatic oxidative phosphorylation, necrosis
and apoptosis, which ultimately result in hepatocarcinogenicity (Burka et al., 1991;
Fransson-Steen et al., 1997; Mugford et al., 1997; Peterson et al., 2006). While this
enedialdehyde metabolite has been demonstrated to form DNA adducts in vitro,
DNA adducts have not been found in vivo in studies with male Fischer 344 rats

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

501

that were administered [14C]furan, supporting a non-genotoxic mechanism of
hepatocarcinogenicity (Burka et al., 1991; Byrns et al., 2006). The furan derivatives
described in this monograph are used as flavouring substances at levels that are
orders of magnitude below the levels of furan administered in the 2-year bioassay.
Additionally, the non-genotoxic mechanism of action by furan through an
enedialdehyde metabolite is the principal metabolic pathway available to furan. The
substituted furan derivatives have additional metabolic options available to them
that prevent high concentrations of enedialdehyde metabolites from forming.
2.2

Toxicological studies

2.2.1 Acute toxicity
Oral median lethal doses (LD50 values) have been reported for 10 of the 40
flavouring agents in this group (see Table 2). In rats, LD50 values are in the range
from 138 to 4458 mg/kg bw, demonstrating that the oral acute toxicity of furansubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids
and related esters, sulfides, disulfides and ethers is low (Long, 1977a, 1977b;
Moreno, 1977; Gabriel, 1979; Moran et al., 1980; Piccirillo et al., 1982, 1983a,
1983b; Reagan & Becci, 1984a, 1984b; Burdock & Ford, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c,
1990d). In mice, oral LD50 values ranged from 438 mg/kg bw for 2-acetyl-5methylfuran (No. 1504) to 1220 mg/kg bw for 2-pentylfuran (No. 1491)
(Shellenberger, 1971a; Griffiths & Babish, 1978; Moran et al., 1980).

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–200 g were given single
intraperitoneal injections of 2-methylfuran (No. 1487) at doses ranging from 50 to
400 mg/kg bw and were killed after 24 h. At 50 mg/kg bw, some hepatic endothelial
injury was produced. At 100 mg/kg bw, centrilobular hepatocytes showed early
necrosis. Extensive centrilobular necrosis was produced at 400 mg/kg bw. In
addition, injury to bronchiolar and bronchial epithelium was produced at 100 mg/kg
bw and progressed to necrosis at 400 mg/kg bw (Ravindranath et al., 1986).
2.2.2 Short-term studies of toxicity
The results of short-term studies with 10 representative furan-substituted
aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and related
esters, sulfides, disulfides and ethers are summarized in Table 3 and described
below. One study was carried out with an alkyl-substituted furan derivative
(No. 1491), four studies with three furan-substituted ketones (Nos 1495, 1503, 1506

a furan-substituted ether (No. 1520) and one study with a furan-substituted thioester
(No. 1526). In addition, two studies are available for the products formed when
thioesters (Nos 1525 and 1526) are hydrolysed in vivo.
(a)

2-Pentylfuran (No. 1491)

Sprague-Dawley albino rats (23 per sex per group) were maintained on a
diet calculated to provide an average daily intake of 2-pentylfuran (purity not given)
at 25.6 or 26.0 mg/kg bw for males and females, respectively, for 13 weeks. Food
and water were provided ad libitum. Weekly measurement of body weights, food
consumption and food utilization revealed no differences between test and control
groups. Animals were observed daily for clinical signs of toxicity and behaviour.
During weeks 6 and 13, urinary analysis was performed on eight males and females
from each group. At week 6, eight males and females from each group were
sacrificed by exsanguination for haematological examination. The remaining 15
males and 15 females were sacrificed at the end of week 13. All animals were
necropsied and tissues examined for macroscopic lesions. The kidneys, liver,
spleen, heart and testes or ovaries were weighed. Major tissues, including brain,
pituitary, thyroid and salivary glands, lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric), lung,
diaphragm, heart, liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, femur with marrow, small
intestine, large intestine, spleen, adrenals, kidney (transverse and longitudinal
sections), testes and anexa, ovaries, uterus, bladder, spinal cord (thoracic), skin
and any lesions were preserved in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin
blocks for histological evaluation. Haematological examination and urinary analysis
revealed no differences between test and control rats. Test group rats revealed a
statistically significant increase in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
compared with controls at week 13. However, in control males, the value for serum
ALP level was 334 international units (IU) at week 6 and inexplicably dropped to
116 IU at week 13, whereas in control females, ALP concentration dropped from
346 to 120 IU from week 6 to week 13. Additionally, the author reported that serum
ALP levels were still within the normal range and thus were not considered
biologically significant. Some male and female animals showed lung tissue that was
mildly hyperaemic, a chronic respiratory condition common among this strain of rats.
The average liver weight for treated males was significantly greater than the liver
weights of control animals. Female rats revealed significant increases in liver and
kidney weights when compared with the control group. However, examination of
these organs revealed no evidence of histopathology (Shellenberger, 1971c).
Furthermore, the author stated that the organ weights for the control male and
female groups were significantly lower than those of control animals of the same
strain and age used in a variety of studies under the same conditions
(Shellenberger, 1971a). Based on lower control organ weights and the absence of
organ histopathology, the authors concluded that no effect could be attributed to the
administration of 2-pentylfuran in the diet of rats (Shellenberger, 1971b).

2,3-Dimethylbenzofuran (No. 1495)

Groups of 15 male and 15 female Sprague-Dawley-derived OFA rats 4–5
weeks of age were administered 2,3-dimethylbenzofuran (purity not given) at
0.6 mg/kg bw per day in olive oil by gavage 7 days per week for a period of 13 weeks.
A concurrently maintained control was administered the vehicle substance. Water
and food were provided ad libitum. Animals were subject to daily examination and
observations of behaviour. Body weights for each rat and food consumption for each
cage of four animals were measured weekly. Haematology and serum biochemistry
were performed for eight males and eight females at weeks 4 (serum biochemistry
limited to blood urea nitrogen) and 13. At 13 weeks, 16 male and 16 female control
and treated rats were necropsied. The liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, adrenal glands,
testes and ovaries were weighed. Major tissue types were preserved for
histopathological examination.
Clinical examinations revealed no differences in the mortality, behaviour,
body weight gain or food consumption for either test group in comparison with the
corresponding group of control animals. Administration of 2,3-dimethylbenzofuran
for 13 weeks showed no effect on haematology tests. Serum biochemistry revealed
a slight increase in ALP activity in males and a slight increase in bilirubin levels in
males and females administered the substance. A decrease in the serum glucose
level of test group females was also observed. At necropsy, pericarditis or an
induration of the thymus was observed in three treated and four control animals. In
the opinion of the author, these findings were likely a result of intubation error. All
organ weights were comparable between test and control animals, and histology
revealed no morphological changes that could be attributed to the administration of
2,3-dimethylbenzofuran (Long, 1977a).
(c)

3-(2-Furyl)acrolein (No. 1497)

In a 30-day study, CD(SD)BR/VAF Plus rats (five per sex per dose) were
administered 22 doses of 3-(2-furyl)acrolein (99% pure) at 100 or 400 mg/kg bw via
corn oil gavage. Other groups of five male and female rats were given 3-(2-furyl)acrolein at 800 mg/kg bw on day 0, which resulted in morbidity and mortality in two
females by day 1. The two females were replaced, and the dose was continued at
600 mg/kg bw per day for the remainder of the study. Food and water were provided
ad libitum throughout the study. Body weights were determined on days 0, 4, 7, 14,
21 and 28, and food consumption was measured on days 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Fasted
body weights were taken prior to necropsy. Rats were monitored daily for signs of
toxicity and behavioural changes. Haematology and clinical chemistry examinations
were conducted with blood drawn from the posterior vena cava prior to necropsy.
At necropsy, rats were fasted overnight, anaesthetized by carbon dioxide and
exsanguinated via the posterior vena cava. The liver, kidneys, adrenal glands,
testes, spleen and thymus were weighed. All major organs, tissue types and lesions
from all animals were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. All tissues from the high-dose
and control groups were examined microscopically, and the thymus, stomach, liver,
kidneys and macroscopic lesions were examined from the low- and mid-dose
groups.

506

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

As reported above, two female rats administered 800 mg/kg bw per day died
or were moribund on day 1 of the study, and one female rat from the mid-dose (400
mg/kg bw per day) group was found dead on day 2. The cause of death for the middose female could not be determined owing to the autolysis that had taken place
by the time of discovery. All other animals survived to the completion of the study.
Clinical signs observed included dehydration, decreased faeces (quantitative data
not provided), depressed general activity levels and sialorrhoea in mid- and highdose (600 mg/kg bw per day) groups. The authors proposed that the sialorrhoea
may have been due to the taste of the test material.
The mean body weights of high-dose males were significantly lower than
those of control animals on days 4, 7, 14 and 21; although they were lower on day
28, the difference was not statistically significant. Mean body weights of high-dose
females were slightly lower than those of controls on days 1 and 4, but were higher
than those of controls from day 7 to termination of the study. The mean body weight
for mid-dose females was also higher on day 14 and onward when compared with
controls. For mid-dose males and low-dose males and females, mean body weights
were comparable with those of controls.
Feed consumption in male and female rats was significantly lower (74%) on
day 4 for the high-dose group that received 600 mg/kg bw per day when compared
with the day 4 controls. Mean feed consumption was also significantly decreased
for the high-dose males on day 7. High-dose female rats showed increased feed
consumption compared with controls on day 7, which reached statistical
significance on days 21 through 28.
High-dose males showed a significantly lower mean haematocrit and
increased mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentrations. Lower mean red blood
cell counts were noted for high-dose males; however, they were not significant. Very
slightly lower mean haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentrations
were noted for male rats in the low- and mid-dose groups; however, these changes
were not significant. Mid- and high-dose females showed a significant reduction in
mean red blood cell counts, mean haemoglobin concentrations and mean
haematocrit values, whereas low-dose females showed reduced values for these
parameters without statistical significance. The reduction in haematology values
indicates a loss of red blood cells. This most likely was due to gastric irritation, since
no other sites of possible haemorrhage were identified. Minimal poikilocytosis (a
common variant of erythrocyte morphology) was observed in 2/5 male rats from
each test group and in 1/5, 1/5, 1/5 and 2/5 female rats from the control, low-dose,
mid-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. Mean glucose levels were
significantly lower and mean sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) levels were higher for
high-dose males. One mid-dose male rat showed a significant increase in SDH level
when compared with controls. Mean SDH levels were significantly higher for highdose females when compared with controls. Mean total protein levels were
significantly lower for male rats in the high- and low-dose groups. The mean albumin
levels and albumin/globulin ratios were significantly lower for low-dose males.
The mean relative kidney weights for the high- and mid-dose males were
higher compared with those of controls, but only the mid-dose group reached

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

507

statistical significance. The mean absolute and relative kidney weights for high-dose
female rats were significantly greater than those of controls. Clinical chemistry did
not indicate nephrotoxicity related to administration of the test material. The mean
absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased for the mid- and highdose male and female groups. Relative thymus weights for the high-dose males
were significantly increased; however, this was considered to be reflective of lower
terminal body weights for this group rather than related to test substance
administration. No macroscopic pathology was related to treatment according to the
authors of the study.
Treatment-related histopathology noted for mid- and high-dose males
included hyperkeratosis (5/5) and acanthosis (5/5) of the non-glandular stomach
(forestomach) mucosa, hypertrophy of hepatocytes (4/5 for the mid-dose group and
4/5 for the high-dose group) and an increased number of hepatocytes with enlarged
nuclei (4/5 for the mid-dose group and 5/5 for the high-dose group). Females
revealed hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the non-glandular stomach mucosa,
hypertrophy of the hepatocytes and increased number of hepatocytes with enlarged
nuclei (4/4 for the mid-dose group and 5/5 for the high-dose group). Hypertrophy of
hepatocytes (1/5) and increased number of hepatocytes with enlarged nuclei (1/5)
were observed for low-dose female rats. The test material was a strong gastric
irritant, which accounts for the hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the non-glandular
stomach mucosa observed in mid- and high-dose rats. The study pathologist
concluded that hypertrophy of the hepatocytes and enlarged nuclei of hepatocytes
were considered adaptive responses to the influx of large amounts of 3-(2-furyl)acrolein via gavage to compensate for increased metabolic activity, not to any
toxicity related to the test substance. The authors concluded that the no-observedadverse-effect level (NOAEL) for 3-(2-furyl)acrolein was 100 mg/kg bw per day in
rats (Faber & Hosenfeld, 1992).

3-(2-Furyl)acrolein (No. 1497), 2-furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) and
isobutyl 3-(2-furan)propionate (No. 1514)

In a subchronic study, Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated into groups of 32
per sex for the control and low dietary intake level, 12 per sex for the mid-range
group and 10 per sex for the high-intake group. The rats were maintained on diets
calculated to provide 3-(2-furyl)acrolein at 0, 5, 45 or 405 mg/kg bw per day, 2-furyl
methyl ketone at 0, 5, 25 or 100 mg/kg bw per day or isobutyl 3-(2-furan)propionate
at 0, 35, 175 or 875 mg/kg bw per day for 28 days. The animals were provided ad
libitum access to food and water throughout the study. Animals were observed daily
for clinical manifestations of toxicity and changes in behaviour. Body weights and
food consumption were recorded weekly. Haematology, blood chemistry and
urinary analyses were conducted at 4 weeks. At the end of 28 days, all of the high
intake level rats and 16 per sex of the control and low intake level rats were sacrificed
by ether anaesthesia and subsequent exsanguination. The remaining animals
continued on test for 90 days.
In the 3-(2-furyl)acrolein study, a significant decrease in body weight gain
was noted for males and females in the 405 mg/kg bw per day dietary exposure
group when compared with controls at week 4. At the 45 mg/kg bw per day dietary

508

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

level, males showed decreased body weight gains at week 12. Decreases in body
weight gain were accompanied by decreased food intake, which may have been
related to the palatability of the test material. Animals at the two lower doses
exhibited inconsistent intervals of low food consumption. Haematological and
urinary analyses were comparable between test groups and control animals at 28
and 90 days. Blood chemistry analysis revealed significant decreases in ALP and
glucose levels for the 405 mg/kg bw per day group at 28 days. Necropsy revealed
no significant macroscopic pathology. At 28 days, the mean relative liver weights of
females in the high-exposure group were significantly increased. At 4 weeks, the
mean relative right and left kidney weights were increased for the 405 mg/kg bw per
day group, whereas after 13 weeks, mean relative right kidney weights were
increased for the 5 mg/kg bw per day male group and mean relative left kidney
weights were elevated for the low-exposure females. No increased kidney weights
or any other organ weights were observed in the 45 mg/kg bw per day group
compared with controls. These organ weight increases were not accompanied by
any evidence of macroscopic or microscopic pathology. The 45 mg/kg bw per day
dietary level for 90 days was considered to be the NOAEL for 3-(2-furyl)acrolein.
In the 2-furyl methyl ketone study, male and female rats in the 100 mg/kg bw
per day group showed decreased body weight gain at day 28. Males at week 13
and females at week 9 in the 25 mg/kg bw per day groups showed reduced body
weight gain compared with controls. These body weight changes corresponded in
part to changes in food consumption. Males and females in the 100 mg/kg bw per
day groups showed a significant decrease in food consumption. Females in the 5
and 25 mg/kg bw per day groups showed a significant decrease in food consumption
when compared with controls; however, the corresponding male groups did not
show decreased food consumption. At 4 weeks, male and female rats in the
100 mg/kg bw per day groups showed a significant increase in the blood urea
nitrogen level and significant decreases in glucose and ALP levels when compared
with controls. Macroscopic pathological examinations were comparable for control
animals and test animals. Male and female rats at the 100 mg/kg bw per day intake
level showed increased mean relative liver weights when compared with controls.
Absolute liver weights were comparable with those of controls, suggesting that lower
body weights in the high-dose group may have been partly responsible for the
observed increased relative liver weights. At treatment termination, mean absolute
and relative liver weights were comparable between the control and high-dose
groups. Rats at lower intake levels exhibited no significant difference in organ
weights compared with control animals. At 28 days, males receiving 100 mg/kg bw
per day showed increased right and left gonad weights, without similar findings for
the 5 and 25 mg/kg bw per day exposure groups after 90 days. No abnormal
histopathology accompanied any of the organ weight differences. The NOAEL for
dietary administration of 2-furyl methyl ketone to rats for 90 days was determined
to be 25 mg/kg bw per day.
In the isobutyl 3(2-furan)propionate study, the death of one low-dose female
was reported to be unrelated to the test compound. Males on the diet designed to
provide 175 or 875 mg/kg bw per day showed a significant reduction in body weight
gain at 28 days, which persisted for the 175 mg/kg bw per day group up to week

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

509

11. No such changes were seen in the corresponding females or in the low dietary
exposure level males or females. Males and females in the high dietary exposure
group showed a significant reduction in food intake when compared with controls.
Haematological, clinical biochemical and urinary analyses revealed no differences
between test groups and controls. Macroscopic pathology revealed no significant
lesions that could be associated with administration of the test substance.
Measurement of relative organ weights revealed non-dose-related increases in the
relative right kidney weight of males in the 35 mg/kg bw per day group and females
in the 175 mg/kg bw per day group and the relative right gonad weight of males in
the 175 mg/kg bw per day group. The authors stated that most of the organ weight
differences were inconsistent as to occurrence, sex and unilateral involvement of
bilateral organs and that it was difficult to ascertain whether they represented
treatment-related effects. In the absence of a clear dose–response relationship, the
changes cannot be associated with administration of the test substance. No
abnormal histopathology was observed in either sex of rat at any dietary level.
Based on these results, the NOEL for rats maintained on diets designed to provide
isobutyl 3-(2-furan)propionate at doses of 35, 175 and 875 mg/kg bw per day for up
to 90 days was 875 mg/kg bw per day (Lough et al., 1985).
(e)

2-Phenyl-3-(2-furyl)prop-2-enal (No. 1502)

Groups of 15 male and 15 female Sprague-Dawley-derived OFA rats 4–5
weeks of age were administered 2-phenyl-3-(2-furyl)prop-2-enal (purity not given)
at 0.87 mg/kg bw per day in olive oil via gavage 7 days per week for a period of 13
weeks. A concurrently maintained control was administered the vehicle substance.
Water and food were provided ad libitum. Animals were subject to daily examination
and observations of behaviour. Body weights for each rat and food consumption for
each cage of four animals were measured weekly. Haematology and serum
biochemistry were performed for eight males and eight females at weeks 4 (serum
biochemistry limited to blood urea nitrogen) and 13. At 13 weeks, 16 male and 16
female control and dosed rats were necropsied. The liver, kidneys, spleen, heart,
adrenal glands, testes and ovaries were weighed. Major tissue types were
preserved for histopathological examination.
Clinical examinations revealed no differences in the mortality, behaviour,
body weight gain or food consumption for either test group in comparison with the
corresponding group of control animals. Administration of 2-phenyl-3-(2-furyl)prop-2-enal produced no haematological effect. At 13 weeks, serum biochemistry
revealed a decrease in the blood urea levels in male rats and a decrease in the
cholesterol levels in both sexes of treated animals; however, the fluctuations in
clinical chemistry values were reported to remain within the normal range of
variation. With the exception of findings reported to have likely occurred as a result
of gavage error, macroscopic examination showed no lesions attributable to the
administration of the test substance. Organ weights were comparable between test
and control groups, and histological examination revealed no evidence of alterations
that could be related to administration of 2-phenyl-3-(2-furyl)prop-2-enal (Long,
1977b).

4-(2-Furyl)-3-buten-2-one (No. 1511)

Groups of five male and five female Fischer 344 rats were maintained on
diets that provided 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one at doses of 0 (control) or an estimated
30 mg/kg bw per day for 14 days. Animals were examined for viability twice daily.
Body weights were recorded on days 1, 6 and 14 of the study, and food consumption
was measured on days 7 and 14. Necropsy was performed on each of the animals
at the end of the study. Kidney and liver weights were recorded prior to fixation in
10% buffered formalin for histological examination. All macroscopic lesions were
also fixed for histological examination.
Treatment with 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one resulted in no adverse clinical
effects. A slight increase in food consumption was noted in females; however, no
such increase was observed with the males, and there was no corresponding
increase in weight gain. Absolute and relative liver weights for females and relative
liver weights for males fed a diet containing 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one were
increased compared with controls by 13%, 15% and 8%, respectively; however, no
histological findings accompanied these increases. The authors stated that, when
compared with control animals of the same strain from the same vendor used in
other studies under identical conditions, the absolute liver weights of the control
animals in this study were lower than usual. The authors concluded that dietary
administration of 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one produced no evidence of toxic effects
under the conditions of this study (Gill & Van Miller, 1987).
(g)

3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran (No. 1506) and furfuryl methyl ether
(No. 1520)

Groups of five male and five female Fischer 344 rats were maintained on
diets estimated to provide 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran at 0 (control) or 10 mg/kg bw
per day or furfuryl methyl ether at 0 (control) or 27 mg/kg bw per day for 14 days.
Animals were examined for viability twice daily. Body weights were recorded on
days 1, 6 and 14 of the study, and food consumption was measured on days 7 and
14. Necropsy was performed on each of the animals at the end of the study. Kidney
and liver weights were recorded prior to fixation in 10% buffered formalin for
histological examination. All macroscopic lesions were also fixed for histological
examination. No statistically significant differences in any of the parameters tested
were noted between treated and control animals. The authors concluded that dietary
administration of 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran or furfuryl methyl ether produced no
evidence of toxic effects under the conditions of this study (Van Miller & Weaver,
1987).
(h)

O-Ethyl S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (No. 1526)

Wistar rats (three per sex per dose) were administered doses of 0 (control),
2, 8 or 32 mg O-ethyl S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (99% pure)/kg bw per day by
gavage for 28 days in a study conducted according to Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Observations for mortality were
made twice daily, and clinical signs were recorded once daily. Body weights and
food consumption were recorded weekly. All animals surviving to the end of the

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

511

study period and all moribund rats were necropsied, and organ weights were
measured. There were no mortalities during the study period. A simultaneous
decrease in body weight and food consumption was reported in the high-dose
(32 mg/kg bw per day) group. The body weights of the control males were slightly
lower than the body weights of historical control groups. There were no significant
differences in body weight and food consumption between the low- (2 mg/kg bw per
day) or mid-dose (8 mg/kg bw per day) groups and the control animals. Hunched
posture, laboured respiration and diarrhoea were reported in the high-dose group,
primarily during the 1st week of treatment. The female animals at the high dose level
showed a reduction in motor activity at the end of the treatment period. Weekly
functional observation tests showed no differences between treated and control
animals in hearing ability, papillary reflex, static righting reflex or grip strength. In
the 8 mg/kg bw per day group, diarrhoea was observed in one male on 1 day in
week 4. At necropsy, organ weights and haematological and macroscopic
evaluations did not reveal any treatment-related effects. Mean urea value was
increased in high-dose females, which was attributed to an increased level in one
of the rats. A slight increase in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity values
was reported for one male in each of the low- and mid-dose groups when compared
with controls. However, in the absence of liver weight changes and abnormalities
and a dose-related effect, this was considered not to be related to administration of
the test material. A NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw per day was established for O-ethyl
S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (van Otterdijk & Frieling, 2001).
(i)

Structurally related substance 2,5-dimethyl-3-furan thioisovalerate
(No. 1070)1

In a 90-day study, 2,5-dimethyl-3-furan thioisovalerate (No. 1070) at 0
(control) or 0.73 mg/kg bw per day was added to the diet of groups of male and
female (15 per sex per group) Wistar rats. The survival, behaviour and general
appearance of rats were monitored daily, whereas body weights and food
consumption were recorded on a weekly basis. Haematology, blood chemistry and
urinary analysis (eight per sex per group) were performed during the 6th and 12th
weeks of the study period. At the end of the treatment period, all surviving animals
were necropsied, and the liver and kidneys were weighed. Tissues from major
organs were preserved for histopathological examination. No significant variations
were observed in the body weights, food consumption and calculated food utilization
efficiency of treated animals in comparison with controls. Likewise, haematological
and blood chemistry parameters were comparable between control and test
animals, and urinary analysis was unremarkable. Moreover, neither macroscopic
nor histopathological examination revealed any significant compound-related
difference between test and control animals (Morgareidge & Oser, 1974).

Structurally related substance furfuryl mercaptan (No. 1072)1

In a 13-week study, groups of 15 weanling Wistar rats of each sex were given
daily doses of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 3 or 30 mg furfuryl mercaptan (No. 1072)/kg bw
in corn oil by stomach tube for a period of 13 weeks (7 days per week). Additional
satellite groups of five rats per sex were administered daily doses of 0, 3 or 30 mg
furfuryl mercaptan/kg bw for periods of 2 or 6 weeks. Clinical observations were
performed daily. Body weights were measured initially on days 1, 6 and 9 and then
weekly up to week 12. Food and water intakes were measured 1 day prior to the
weight measurements.
At the highest dose level, a significant decrease in body weight gain
observed in both males and females beginning on days 6–9 and continuing until
study termination (12–16% final body weight reductions) was associated with a
significantly reduced food intake. Furthermore, several differences in organ weights
were observed in high-dose animals (i.e. 30 mg/kg bw per day) at the conclusion of
the study. Significant organ weight differences, primarily consisting of reductions in
absolute organ weights and increases in relative organ weights (i.e. brain, kidneys,
stomach, small intestine, caecum, adrenals and gonads in males, and brain, heart,
liver, kidneys, stomach, caecum, adrenals and thyroid in females) were reported for
the 30 mg/kg bw per day group at 13 weeks and were thought to be associated with
the lower body weights. In addition to isolated organ weight changes in males and
females at the high-dose level in the satellite group terminated at week 6, increased
relative heart weights in males and reduced relative kidney weights in females were
reported for the group at the 3 mg/kg bw per day dose level. These changes were
not present in the 13-week group at the mid-dose level (i.e. 3 mg/kg bw per day)
and as such were considered to be unrelated to the administration of the test
substance. Urinary analysis, including concentration and dilution tests, performed
on the last day of treatment revealed no significant differences between test and
control groups. Likewise, no significant variations were observed in clinical
chemistry values. In high-dose males, statistically significant variations in
haematological parameters included increased packed cell volume and total
leukocyte counts at week 6 and increases in haemoglobin concentration and packed
cell volume at study termination; however, these changes were not considered to
represent a toxicologically significant adverse effect. At study termination,
macroscopic and microscopic examinations showed no lesions related to the
administration of the test substance. Based on organ weight changes confined to
the highest dose group, the authors concluded that 3 mg/kg bw per day was the
NOAEL (Phillips et al., 1977).
2.2.3 Genotoxicity studies
Genotoxicity testing has been performed on eight (Nos 1487, 1488, 1494,
1497, 1503, 1511, 1513 and 1526) representative furan-substituted aliphatic
hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and related esters,
sulfides, disulfides and ethers in this group. The results of these tests are
summarized in Table 4 and described below.

In vitro

In standard Salmonella mutagenicity assays, 2,5-dimethylfuran (No. 1488),
3-methyl-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-furan (No. 1494), 3-(2-furyl)acrolein (No. 1497),
4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one (No. 1511), ethyl 3-(2-furyl)propanoate (No. 1513) and
O-ethyl S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (No. 1526) were not mutagenic in
Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, TA1537 or
TA1538 when tested at concentrations of up to 10 000 μg/plate, alone or in the
presence of an exogenous rat liver metabolic activation system (S9) (Wild et al.,
1983; Mortelmans et al., 1986; Shinohara et al., 1986; Asquith, 1989; Eder et al.,
1991; Zeiger et al., 1992; Lee et al., 1994; Verspeek-Rip, 2000). Likewise, with the
exception of a single assay in which equivocal results of mutagenicity were reported
in S. typhimurium strains TA97 and TA107 (Zeiger et al., 1992), 2-methylfuran
(No. 1487) was consistently negative in several other strains of S. typhimurium (i.e.
TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA1535) both alone and with an exogenous rat liver
bioactivation system (S9) (Shinohara et al., 1986; Aeschbacher et al., 1989).
Evaluated alone and with an exogenous bioactivation system in S. typhimurium at
concentrations of up to 0.660 μmol/plate (54.2 μg/plate), 2-furyl methyl ketone (No.
1503) exhibited a significant positive mutagenic potential only in strain TA98 with
bioactivation at the two lower concentrations (i.e. 0.165 and 0.330 μmol/plate)
(Shinohara et al., 1986). At higher concentrations, significant cytotoxicity was
observed, which was reflected by a concentration-dependent decrease in the
number of revertants.
Bacterial mutagenicity testing of furans that can be metabolically oxidized
to reactive Į,ȕ-unsaturated dicarbonyl (2-ene-1,4-dicarbonyl) intermediates is
problematic owing to their high bacterial toxicity. The cytotoxicity of these
substances is believed to arise from their interactions with protein sulfhydryl and
amino groups (Marnett et al., 1985; Eder et al., 1992). Owing to the nature of the
GSH conjugation pathway, genotoxicity studies in which high concentrations of
Į,ȕ-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are formed are likely to create oxidative
stress. It is anticipated that cells exposed to high concentrations of these types of
substances will rapidly deplete GSH levels, eventually leading to cellular damage
and decreased cell viability, as indicated by the above study results.
O-Ethyl S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (No. 1526) showed no mutagenic
potential when tested in Escherichia coli WP2uvrA at concentrations of up to 3330
μg/plate, either alone or with a bioactivation system (Verspeek-Rip, 2000).
Evaluated in E. coli PQ37 under the conditions of the SOS chromotest, 3-(2-furyl)acrolein (No. 1497) tested negative (Eder et al., 1991); however, in a subsequent
evaluation, 3-(2-furyl)acrolein (No. 1497) as well as 2-furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503)
were slightly positive in the SOS chromotest without metabolic activation, as
evidenced by 1.72- and 1.75-fold increases, respectively, in the SOS induction
factor over a background value of 1 (results were considered to be significant if the
induction factor was at least 1.5) (Eder et al., 1993).
In the rec assay, which is based on differential inhibition of growth of
repair-deficient strains as a measure of DNA-damaging activity, Bacillus subtilis
strains H17 (rec+) and M45 (recí) were incubated with 2-methylfuran (No. 1487),

520

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

2,5-dimethylfuran (No. 1488) and 2-furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) at concentrations
of up to 55 000 μg/disc, alone and with metabolic activation (Shinohara et al., 1986).
2-Furyl methyl ketone tested negative at a concentration of 550 μg/disc, but was
reportedly positive at concentrations of 5500 μg/disc and greater alone and with
metabolic activation. Likewise, 2,5-dimethylfuran was negative at the lowest
concentration tested (i.e. 190 μg/disc) with metabolic activation, but tested positive
at every concentration tested in the absence of metabolic activation. In contrast,
2-methylfuran was negative with metabolic activation and induced significant
differences in the zones of inhibition only without metabolic activation. Additionally,
2-methylfuran and 2-acetylfuran were reported to cleave the double strand of
Ȝ-phage DNA in the presence of Cu2+; however, a negative control was not included,
and, therefore, the statistical significance of these results was not ascertained. Also,
it should be noted that potential concomitant cytotoxicity was not monitored in
this study.
The potential mammalian cell clastogenicities of 2-methylfuran (No. 1487),
2,5-dimethylfuran (No. 1488) and 2-furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) were evaluated
in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, in which induction of chromosomal
aberrations was measured. Cells were exposed to substances from commercial
sources (purity not given) for 3 h, followed by 20 h of maintenance. In the absence
of exogenous metabolic activation, all three compounds produced increases in the
number of chromosomal aberrations, mainly chromatid exchanges; however, in the
presence of rat liver metabolic activation, only the clastogenicity of 2-furyl methyl
ketone was increased, whereas the clastogenic activities of 2-methylfuran and 2,5dimethylfuran were reduced in comparison with test systems without metabolic
activation. Additionally, the authors noted that when NADP was eliminated from the
activation system, the reduction in the chromosomal aberrations observed for 2methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran and the increase in the clastogenic activity
observed with 2-furyl methyl ketone in the presence of the activation system were
abolished. This suggests that mixed-function oxidases are integral in the
metabolism of alkyl furan derivatives. It should be noted that the experiment with 2furyl methyl ketone was performed at a limited number of concentrations (two), the
active one of which far exceeded (112.6 mmol/l = 13 220 μg/ml) standard
concentration limits for this assay and was toxic (Stich et al., 1981).
Beginning in the late 1980s, researchers began studying test conditions
(osmolality, ionic strength, low pH) that could cause an increase in clastogenic
activity (increased chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei) in the absence of any
chemical-induced effect on DNA (Zajac-Kaye & Ts’o, 1984; Brusick, 1986; Bradley
et al., 1987; Galloway et al., 1987; Seeberg et al., 1988; Morita et al., 1989; Scott
et al., 1991). More recent research indicates that extreme culture conditions (hypoand hyperosmolality and high pH) induce apoptosis and necrosis, leading to DNA
fragmentation and producing false-positive responses in clastogenic assays
(Meintières & Marzin, 2004).
Apoptosis is a type of cell death that occurs under physiological conditions
or in response to external stimuli (e.g. DNA-damaging agents, growth factor
deprivation or receptor triggering). The mechanism of formation of apoptotic cells
includes activation of cysteine proteases (caspases), leading to increased

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

521

mitochondrial permeability, release of cytochrome c, DNA cleavage and redistribution of phosphatidylserine to the outer layers of the cell membrane, which
enhances binding of cells to phagocytes. DNA cleavage, owing to irreversible
activation of endonucleases, is followed by chromatin condensation and
oligonucleosomal fragmentation due to double-strand cleavage of DNA in
nucleosomal linker regions (Saraste & Pulkki, 2000). During chromatin
condensation, the nucleus may split into a number of dense micronuclei.
Fragmented DNA and chromatin condensation due to apoptotic events are not
easily distinguished from direct action of a specific chemical.
In consideration of such knowledge, findings of chromosomal aberrations
must be evaluated in the context of the potential for apoptosis to occur under test
conditions. Relatively high concentrations (i.e. up to 1923–13 220 μg/ml or 20–150
mmol/l) were used in the study conducted by Stich et al. (1981). The Km for most
enzyme kinetic processes is at or below 100 μmol/l (Bu, 2006; Wang & James,
2006), and thus the high concentrations used in this study may not be relevant to
the human condition, especially with respect to the low levels of flavouring agents
added to food. Furthermore, no information was available on culture conditions that
may have promoted apoptosis. Results of chromosomal aberration and micronuclei
assays are problematic to interpret in the absence of such information.
2-Furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) was evaluated for induction of unscheduled
DNA synthesis (UDS) in human hepatocytes following OECD guidelines. Human
(sex not given) hepatocytes from two batches purchased from a commercial
provider were incubated with concentrations of compound (purity not given) of
between 2.19 and 280 μg/ml for 16 h, and UDS was measured autoradiographically.
No UDS was elicited, in contrast to the positive control, 2-acetylaminofluorene
(Durward, 2007a).
In a study examining the effect of oxygen scavengers on cadmium chloride–
induced chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster V79 cells, 2,5-dimethylfuran
(No. 1488) at 96.13 μg/ml (1 mmol/l) did not increase the frequency of chromosomal
aberrations in comparison with control values. When 2,5-dimethylfuran at 96.13 μg/
ml (1 mmol/l) was incubated with the V79 cells in the presence of cadmium chloride,
no reduction in the clastogenic capacity of cadmium chloride was observed (Ochi
& Ohsawa, 1985).
O-Ethyl-S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (No. 1526) was evaluated for
potential clastogenicity in a series of tests in human peripheral lymphocytes.
Doses at which chromosomal aberrations were evaluated were based on a
preliminary evaluation of effects on the mitotic index in the cells. Generally, O-ethylS-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate exhibited marked mitogenicity and cytotoxicity, and
accordingly only a relatively narrow range of concentrations was used. In the first
set of tests in which an exposure time of 3 h was utilized, the substance did not
induce an increase at concentrations ranging between 150 and 350 μg/ml alone or
in the presence of a bioactivation system; however, in another test employing a
3-h exposure period with metabolic activation, significant and dose-dependent
increases in the number of chromosomal aberrations were observed at
concentrations of 325 and 375 μg/ml, but not at 150 μg/ml. Moreover, following a

522

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

24- or 48-h exposure period, O-ethyl-S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (up to 280 μg/
ml) also induced dose-dependent and statistically significant increases in the
number of chromosomal aberrations in the absence of metabolic activation in
comparison with a negative control (Meerts, 2000).
(b)

In vivo

As reported in an abstract, 2-methylfuran (No. 1487) (purity not given) did
not induce chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells or spermatocytes of
Swiss albino mice evaluated at 24-h intervals following administration in the diet at
concentrations of 1000, 2000 or 4000 mg/kg (approximately 100, 200 and 400 mg/
kg bw per day, respectively) for a period of 5 days. No positive control was included.
Moreover, the authors noted that 2-methylfuran did not inhibit spindle protein
synthesis or cell division in the somatic cells. In the germ cells, which were evaluated
at weekly intervals for a period of 5 weeks following final dosing, in order to cover
one full spermatogenesis cycle, no structural sperm-head abnormalities were
reported (Subramanyam et al., 1989).
2-Furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) was evaluated for clastogenic activity in
bone marrow and germ cells of Swiss albino mice. Groups of two per dose per
sampling time were administered the compound (99% pure) orally at 0 (control),
1000, 2000 or 3000 mg/l in 0.5 ml of water (approximately 0, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg
bw, respectively) either as a single dose or once daily for 5 consecutive days. No
positive control was included. Bone marrow cells were collected periodically for up
to 72 h following dosing, and meiotic and sperm preparations from testes and
epididymis, respectively, were assessed at 24 h and weekly for a total of 5 weeks
post-dosing. In bone marrow cells, the substance at the high dose level was
observed to inhibit mitosis beginning at 18 h following single- or multiple-dose
treatment. At 24 h, mitodepression was also observed at the high dose level in the
single-dose experiment, as well as at the middle and high dose levels in mice
administered multiple doses. In the repeat-dose test protocol, the effect remained
significant for up to 36 h post-treatment. Mitodepression was accompanied by
increases in the frequency of structural chromosomal aberrations, mainly gaps
and breaks, in the bone marrow cells. Specifically, at the high dose level (i.e. 3000
mg/l), between 18 and 24 h following single-dose administration and 12 and 48 h
following final treatment of multiple-dose groups, the frequency of aberrations was
elevated. Additionally, in animals receiving multiple doses of 2-furyl methyl ketone,
significant increases in the number of chromosomal aberrations were also observed
at the middle dose level (i.e. 2000 mg/l) between 24 and 36 h post-treatment. In
contrast to the dose- and time-dependent increase in chromosomal aberrations in
the somatic cells, only a single isolated increase in structural chromosomal
aberrations was observed in mouse spermatocytes 3 weeks following single-dose
administrations of the substance, and only at the highest dose level. Following
multiple-dose administration, abnormalities in germ cells were limited to significant
increases in polyploidy and XY univalents occurring at weeks 3 and 4 at the highest
dose level. Furthermore, no sperm-head abnormalities were observed at any dose
level, irrespective of the treatment protocol. The absence of sperm-head
abnormalities at all dose levels was indicative of a lack of sperm toxicity of the

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

523

substance. The authors concluded that 2-furyl methyl ketone exhibits only mild
clastogenic activity in mouse bone marrow and is not clastogenic in germ cells
(Sujatha et al., 1993).
2-Furyl methyl ketone was evaluated for induction of sister chromatid
exchanges (SCE) in bone marrow of female Swiss albino mice. Groups of two per
dose per exposure regimen were administered compound (99% pure) at 0, 1000,
2000 or 3000 mg/l via gavage either once or for 5 consecutive days. 5Bromodeoxyuridine was injected intraperitoneally to label chromatids. The mice
were sacrificed at 12, 24 or 48 h after receiving the last dose, and slides of bone
marrow were prepared and processed for differential staining. A dose-related
increase up to about 2-fold in SCE was observed for the 12- and 24-h groups of
both the single-dose regimen and the multiple-dose regimen (Sujatha, 2007).
2-Furyl methyl ketone was evaluated for induction of UDS in hepatocytes
isolated from livers of dosed male Sprague-Dawley rats. The assay was conducted
according to Good Laboratory Practices and OECD guidelines. In a preliminary
range-finding toxicity study, lethality was observed at 30 mg/kg bw and greater, and
signs of toxicity were observed at 20 mg/kg bw. No sex differences were observed,
and therefore only males were used in the main study. Groups of four rats were
administered compound (purity not given) at 0, 7 or 21 mg/kg bw via gavage. In
experiment 1, the hepatocytes were isolated 16 h post-dosing; in experiment 2,
hepatocytes were isolated 2 h post-dosing and cultured for autoradiographic
measurement of UDS. No UDS was observed in either experiment, in contrast to
the positive controls 2-acetylaminofluorene and N,Nƍ-dimethylhydrazine (Durward,
2007b).
O-Ethyl S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (No. 1526) was evaluated for
induction of micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes of NMRI BR mice. Groups of
five per sex per dose per sampling time were administered single doses of
compound (99% pure) at 0 (vehicle control), 100, 250 or 500 mg/kg bw in corn oil
via gavage. Dosed animals at every dose level and controls were killed at 24 h postdosing. Additionally, a second group of high-dose mice (i.e. 500 mg/kg bw) and the
positive control (cyclophosphamide) group were terminated at 48 h post-dosing.
Bone marrow smears were prepared from the femurs. No increase in the incidence
of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in dosed mice
compared with controls, in contrast to the positive control, which induced a 20-fold
increase. However, the authors also noted that cells obtained from dosed animals
did not exhibit a reduction in the ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic
erythrocytes, indicating an absence of toxicity, which could be due to lack of
adequate exposure of bone marrow (Verspeek-Rip, 2001).
(c)

Conclusions

With few exceptions, eight representative substances of this group were
consistently negative in mutation assays conducted in various strains of S.
typhimurium and E. coli under appropriate testing conditions. Negative and positive
results were obtained in the rec assay in B. subtilis for 2-methylfuran and 2,5dimethylfuran. In mammalian genotoxicity assays conducted in CHO and V79 cells

524

FURAN-SUBSTITUTED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

and human peripheral lymphocytes, study results were inconsistent, with both
negative (2,5-dimethylfuran, O-ethyl-S-(2-furylmethyl)thiocarbonate) and positive
(2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran) results reported. Although positive results were
reported in the chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells with 2-methylfuran and
2,5-dimethylfuran, relatively high concentrations were utilized (i.e. up to 13 220 and
1923 μg/ml, respectively); the statistical significance of the results was not specified,
and the potential cytotoxicity was not monitored in the assay. Moreover, as
previously discussed, positive in vitro results of chromosomal aberrations are
difficult to interpret in the presence of concomitant cytotoxicity and cell cycle delay,
which, based on the results of the studies, are a feature of the furan derivatives.
Therefore, it may be expected that mammalian cells in culture might not have
adequate metabolic capacities to counter this toxicity. In fact, with the exception of
one assay in which clastogenic activity was reported for a single compound (i.e. 2furyl methyl ketone) with a metabolic activation system, results obtained with other
representative furan derivatives demonstrated a reduction in the frequency of
chromosomal aberrations in the presence of metabolic activation. Furthermore,
unlike the positive results reported for 2,5-dimethylfuran among several other
compounds evaluated in CHO cells at the high concentrations used in the study of
Stich et al. (1981), 2,5-dimethylfuran, tested at lower concentrations in V79 cells,
did not exhibit clastogenic activity (Ochi & Ohsawa, 1985). The negative findings in
the human hepatocyte DNA damage assay provide evidence that the chromosomal
aberration findings are not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism.
Three representative compounds were studied in in vivo assays. With
2-methylfuran, no increase in chromosomal aberrations was found in either
mouse bone marrow cells or spermatocytes. In a study in which mild clastogenic
activity was reported in mouse bone marrow cells at the middle and high doses
of 2-furyl methyl ketone (i.e. 40 and 60 mg/kg bw, respectively), at which the
authors also reported significant mitodepression following single- and multipledose administrations, no increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed in the
spermatocytes obtained from the same mice, and the weak clastogenic effects
achieved statistical significance only after repeated daily exposure to near-lethal
doses. A study from the same laboratory reported induction of SCEs in mouse bone
marrow cells by 2-furyl methyl ketone. However, 2-furyl methyl ketone did not elicit
UDS in hepatocytes isolated from rat liver, suggesting that any possible in vivo
genotoxicity is not attributable to DNA reactivity. The frequency of micronucleus
formation in bone marrow cells of mice administered single doses of O-ethyl-S-(2furylmethyl)thiocarbonate was comparable with control values (Verspeek-Rip,
2001), although adequacy of exposure was not demonstrated.
In conclusion, results of the in vitro genotoxicity/mutagenicity tests revealed
mixed results, with positive results reported less frequently in the presence of an
activation system. This could indicate metabolic detoxication of these substances.
The in vivo single-dose studies with 2-furyl methyl ketone did not indicate evidence
for genotoxicity, whereas two repeat-dose studies showed weak effects for
induction of chromosomal aberrations and SCEs. However, evidence indicates that
2-furyl methyl ketone does not exhibit DNA reactivity. The basis for the positive
clastogenicity findings remains unclear.

COMMENTS

As stated above, the main concern with this group arises primarily from the
carcinogenicity of furan itself, which is believed to involve a reactive genotoxic
metabolite formed by epoxidation and opening of the furan ring. Furan is not a
member of this group of flavouring agents, but all the members of the group contain
a furan ring with either one or two substituents of varying complexity. In some
flavouring agents, a substituent is present on one side of the furan ring only,
whereas in others, substituents are present on both sides. The presence of an
extended side-chain attached to the furan ring would reduce the potential for
epoxidation of the double bond and provide a site for detoxication via metabolism
and elimination. The flavouring agent that has the simplest structure and would be
predicted to have the greatest potential for ring oxidation is 2-methylfuran (No.
1487); there is evidence from studies in vitro and in vivo that this compound
undergoes bioactivation to a reactive ring-opened metabolite that binds covalently
to both protein and DNA. Data are not available on the influence of the nature and
position of the ring substitution on potential for metabolic activation and adduct
formation. After administration of a single dose, 2-methylfuran produced liver toxicity
in rats from 50 mg/kg bw, but hepatotoxicity has not been reported for other
members of this group in more extensive studies.
Testing for genotoxicity has been performed on eight members of this group
of flavouring agents. The results of the studies of genotoxicity/mutagenicity in vitro
that were already available to the Committee at its previous meeting were both
positive and negative, with most positive results reported for chromosomal
aberration. These, however, were less frequent in the presence of metabolic
activation, indicating possible metabolic detoxication rather than bioactivation. 2Methylfuran (No. 1487), for example, produced chromosomal aberrations in vitro,
but the clastogenic activity was lower in the presence of a metabolizing system. The
limited data available on genotoxicity in vivo showed no evidence of chromosomal
aberration in mouse bone marrow or spermatocytes for 2-methylfuran. 2-Furyl
methyl ketone (No. 1503) also induced no chromosomal aberrations in mouse
spermatocytes, but a weak, transient increase in chromosomal aberrations was
observed in mouse bone marrow, associated with mitodepression. O-Ethyl-S-(2furylmethyl)thiocarbonate (No. 1526) appeared not to induce micronucleus
formation in mouse bone marrow.
The new data on 2-furyl methyl ketone (No. 1503) available to the Committee
at its present meeting were a study on UDS in cultured hepatocytes in vitro, a study
on UDS in rat liver in vivo/in vitro and a test for SCEs in mouse bone marrow in vivo.
2-Furyl methyl ketone did not induce UDS either in vitro or in vivo/in vitro. However,
it did induce SCEs, confirming the concern for clastogenicity as expressed by the
Committee at its previous meeting. The Committee at its present meeting therefore
considered that the new data available did not resolve the concerns expressed
previously.

EVALUATION

The Committee concluded that the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of
Flavouring Agents could not be applied to this group because of the unresolved
toxicological concerns. Studies that would assist in the safety evaluation include
investigations of the influence of the nature and position of ring substitution on
metabolism and on covalent binding to macromolecules. Depending on the findings,
additional studies might include assays related to the mutagenic and carcinogenic
potential of representative members of this group.

The Committee evaluated a group of six hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted
benzyl derivatives, including two vanillin acetals (Nos 1879 and 1882), one vanillin
dimer (No. 1881), one alkoxy-hydroxylbenzaldehyde (No. 1878) and two
alkoxybenzoyloxy derivatives (Nos 1880 and 1883). The evaluations were conducted according to the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents
(Figure 1, Introduction) (Annex 1, reference 131). None of these flavouring agents
has previously been evaluated by the Committee.
The Committee evaluated 46 other members of this group of flavouring
agents at its fifty-seventh meeting (Annex 1, reference 154). In addition, ethyl vanillin

- 533 -

534

HYDROXY- AND ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED BENZYL DERIVATIVES (addendum)

was evaluated at the eleventh meeting of the Committee (Annex 1, reference 14),
and a conditional acceptable daily intake (ADI)1 of 0–10 mg/kg body weight (bw) per
day was assigned. At its thirty-fifth meeting (Annex 1, reference 88), the Committee
converted the conditional ADI to a temporary ADI of 0–5 mg/kg bw per day. At its
thirty-ninth meeting (Annex 1, reference 101), the Committee extended the
temporary ADI of 0–5 mg/kg bw per day. At its forty-fourth meeting (Annex 1,
reference 116), the Committee established an ADI of 0–3 mg/kg bw per day. Vanillin
was evaluated at the eleventh meeting of the Committee and assigned an ADI of
0–10 mg/kg bw per day. Methyl salicylate was evaluated at the eleventh meeting of
the Committee, and an ADI of 0–0.5 mg/kg bw per day was assigned. Piperonal
was evaluated at the eleventh meeting of the Committee and assigned an ADI of
0–2.5 mg/kg bw per day. All other members of this group were evaluated by the
Procedure and concluded to be of no safety concern based on current estimated
levels of intake.
Two of the six flavouring agents in this group are natural components of food
(Nos 1878 and 1881). They have been detected in a variety of fruits, types of honey
and alcoholic beverages, but quantitative data on natural occurrence were not
available (Gatfield, 2006; Nijssen et al., 2007).
1.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The total annual production volume of the six hydroxy- and alkoxysubstituted benzyl derivatives is approximately 822 kg in Europe (European Flavour
and Fragrance Association, 2005), 61 kg in the USA (Gavin et al., 2007) and
204 kg in Japan (Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association, 2002). More
than 99% of the annual production volume in Europe and Japan is accounted for
by vanillin propylene glycol acetal (No. 1882). More than 85% of the annual production volume in the USA is accounted for by sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate
(No. 1880) and 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetic acid (No. 1883). The daily per capita
intake of each flavouring agent is reported in Table 1. Annual volumes of production
of this group of flavouring agents are summarized in Table 2.
1.3

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination

The hydrolysis of aromatic acetals in simulated gastric juice and intestinal
fluid supports the conclusion that the acetal functional group is hydrolysed before
absorption in vivo. Both vanillin 3-(l-menthoxy)propane-1,2-diol acetal (No. 1879)
and vanillin propylene glycol acetal (No. 1882) undergo hydrolysis under acidic
conditions to form the corresponding alcohol and aldehyde, which will be rapidly
metabolized and eliminated. The resulting hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted
derivatives are rapidly absorbed from the intestine, metabolized in the liver and
excreted unchanged or as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. Minor metabolic
pathways include O-demethylation, reduction and/or decarboxylation.

survey correction factor = 0.8 for the surveys by the USA, Europe and Japan, representing
the assumption that only 80% of the annual flavour volume was reported in the poundage
surveys (Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association, 2002; European Flavour and
Fragrance Association, 2005; Gavin et al., 2007).
Intake (μg/kg bw per day) calculated as follows: (μg/person per day)/body weight, where
body weight = 60 kg. Slight variations may occur from rounding.

1.4

Application of the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring
Agents

Step 1.

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents to the
above-mentioned flavouring agents, the Committee assigned five flavouring
agents (Nos 1878–1880, 1882 and 1883) to structural class I (Cramer et al.,
1978). The Committee assigned the remaining flavouring agent (No. 1881) to
structural class III (Cramer et al., 1978).

Step 2.

All the flavouring agents in this group are expected to be metabolized to
innocuous products. The evaluation of all of the flavouring agents in this group
therefore proceeded via the A-side of the Procedure.

Step A3.

The estimated daily per capita intakes of the five flavouring agents
in structural class I are below the threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per
day for class I). The estimated daily per capita intake for the flavouring agent in
structural class III is below the threshold of concern (i.e. 90 μg/person per day
for class III). According to the Procedure, these six flavouring agents raise no
safety concerns when they are used at the current estimated levels of intake.

Table 1 summarizes the evaluations of the six hydroxy- and alkoxysubstituted benzyl derivatives (Nos 1878–1883) in this group.
1.5

Consideration of combined intakes from use as flavouring agents

The flavouring agents in this group are metabolized to a common metabolite,
4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzoic acid (No. 959), in structural class I. For this common
metabolite, the five flavouring agents with the highest intakes, considered in this
and previous evaluations, correspond to Nos 889, 1882, 891, 959 and 886. In the
unlikely event that these five flavouring agents were to be consumed concurrently
on a daily basis, the estimated combined intake1 of 60 826 and 166 140 μg/person
per day in Europe and the USA, respectively, would exceed the threshold of concern

HYDROXY- AND ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED BENZYL DERIVATIVES (addendum)

541

(i.e. 1800 μg/person per day for class I). However, these five flavouring agents, as
well as the other 47 flavouring agents evaluated previously and currently, are all
expected to be metabolized efficiently, and the available metabolic pathways would
not be saturated. Moreover, more than 90% of the potential combined intakes in
both Europe and the USA are accounted for by vanillin (No. 889), for which the
Committee had maintained the ADI of 0–10 mg/kg bw at its fifty-seventh meeting
(Annex 1, reference 154). The Committee noted that the potential combined intakes
do not exceed this ADI. Overall, the evaluation of the data indicated that combined
intake would not raise safety concerns.
1.6

Consideration of secondary components

The three flavouring agents of this group that are derivatives of vanillin
(Nos 1879, 1881 and 1882) have minimum assay values of less than 95%. However,
the major secondary component in each of these is vanillin (No. 889), for which an
ADI of 0–10 mg/kg bw per day has been allocated (Annex 1, reference 14) and
which the Committee concluded was of no safety concern at current estimated
levels of intake as a flavouring agent. Information on the safety of the secondary
component of this compound is summarized in Annex 5 (Summary of the safety
evaluation of secondary components for flavouring agents with minimum assay
values of less than 95%).
1.7

Conclusion

In the previous evaluations of substances in this group, studies of acute
toxicity, short-term studies of toxicity, long-term studies of toxicity and
carcinogenicity, and studies of genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity were available.
None raised safety concerns. The toxicity data available for this evaluation
supported those from the previous evaluations (Annex 1, reference 154).
The Committee concluded that these six flavouring agents, which are
additions to the group of hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted benzyl derivatives
evaluated previously, would not give rise to safety concerns at the current estimated
levels of intake.

RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1

Explanation

This monograph summarizes key aspects relevant to the safety evaluation
of six hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted benzyl derivatives, which are additions to a
group of 46 flavouring agents evaluated previously by the Committee at its fiftyseventh meeting (Annex 1, reference 154).

1

Combined intake was calculated on a molar basis relative to the formation of a common
metabolite. In this instance, the common metabolite is 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzoic acid,
with a relative molecular mass of 168.15.

2.3

Biological data

2.3.1 Biochemical data: hydrolysis, absorption, distribution, metabolism and
excretion
At low pH similar to that found in the stomach, vanillin 3-(l-menthoxy)propane-1,2-diol acetal (No. 1879) readily hydrolyses. In a hydrolysis study,
12–39 mmol vanillin 3-(l-menthoxy)propane-1,2-diol acetal/l underwent 91%
hydrolysis at pH 2 within 45 min. At pH 3, approximately 86% of vanillin 3-(lmenthoxy)propane-1,2-diol acetal hydrolysed within 90 min. At pH 4, approximately
92% of the acetal hydrolysed within 8 h. At pH 5, approximately 12% of the flavouring
agent hydrolysed within 8 h (Reitz, 1995).
Under acidic conditions (pH 2.6), vanillin propylene glycol acetal (No. 1882)
began to hydrolyse immediately, with 92% hydrolysed within 2 h. At pH 1.8,
approximately 90% of vanillin propylene glycol acetal hydrolysed immediately, and
93% hydrolysed within 5 min (Bennett, 1997).
In a disposition study, Wistar rats (three per sex per group) were
administered single doses of sodium [14C]4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate (No. 1880)
either intravenously (50 mg/kg bw) or orally via gavage (500 mg/kg bw). There was
a second group of rats receiving the test material via the oral route that were
pretreated with 1% sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate in the diet for 2 weeks
prior to receiving the sodium [14C]4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate. This dietary level
corresponded to measured intakes of 821 and 953 mg/kg bw per day for males and
females, respectively (de Bie, 1999). The plasma radioactivity level reached its peak
for the 500 mg/kg bw groups by 30 min post-administration for both conventional
and pretreated groups. The plasma kinetics of elimination for all three groups are
summarized in Table 3. Independent of route of administration and sex, the plasma
kinetics of elimination follow a biphasic curve. More than 99% of 14C-labelled sodium
4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate was excreted in the 24-h urine (>95%) and faeces
when administered both intravenously and orally, independent of pretreatment or
sex. Approximately 85% of this was excreted unchanged, and two major
metabolites, 4-methoxybenzoylglycine and 4-hydroxybenzoyloxyacetic acid, were
detected in the urine at 4–7%, depending on the route of administration. Low residue
levels were found in tissues and organs (de Bie, 1999).
Six male human volunteers were orally administered 1 mg sodium
4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate (No. 1880)/kg bw. On average, 85.9% of this dose
was excreted within 24 h as sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate, with 57% of that
excreted within the first 2 h after dosing. There were no detectable amounts of
4-hydroxybenzoyloxyacetic acid or 4-methoxybenzoylglycine found in any urine
samples, although the authors indicated that detecting less than 1–2% would have
been difficult as a result of interfering peaks on the chromatogram (Meuling &
de Bie, 1999).

2.3.2 Toxicological studies
(a)

Acute toxicity

No additional acute toxicity studies for these agents have been reported
since the submission of the original monograph (Annex 1, reference 154).
(b)

Short-term studies of toxicity

(i) Sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate (No. 1880)
In a 13-week study, four groups of Wistar rats (20 per sex per group) were
maintained on diets containing 0, 0.5, 1 or 2% sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate
(No. 1880). These dietary intake levels correspond to estimated daily intake levels
of 0, 340, 690 and 1400 mg/kg bw for males and 0, 390, 810 and 1600 mg/kg bw
for females. Weekly measurement of body weight and food consumption and
calculation of efficiency of food utilization showed no difference between test
and control animals. Haematological examinations, blood chemistry determinations
and urinary analysis conducted at week 13 showed normal values when compared
with controls. At necropsy, there were no significant differences in relative and
absolute organ weights between test and control groups. Histopathological analysis
of the stomach revealed mild hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the squamous
epithelium of the limiting ridge in some animals of the mid- and high-dose groups.

544

Further, there was slight hyperplasia of the urinary bladder epithelium in part of the
highest dose group. Based on these data, the no-observed-adverse-effect level
(NOAEL) was determined to be 0.5% (340 and 390 mg/kg bw per day for males and
females, respectively) (see Table 4) (Lina, 1999).

Genotoxicity

No mutagenic activity was observed when Salmonella typhimurium strains
TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 were incubated with up to 5000 μg of vanillin
3-(l-menthoxy)propane-1,2-diol acetal (No. 1879) or sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate (No. 1880) per plate, with and without metabolic activation (Kajiura,
1996; Van Delft, 1998b).
Similarly, no mutagenic activity was observed when 0–5000 μg divanillin
(No. 1881)/plate was incubated with S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102,
TA1535 and TA1537, with and without metabolic activation, in two replicate studies
(King, 2002). At 1500 and 5000 μg/plate, precipitation was observed (King, 2002).
No mutagenic activity was observed when up to 5000 μg vanillin 3-(lmenthoxy)propane-1,2-diol acetal (No. 1879)/plate was incubated with Escherichia
coli WP2uvrA in the presence or absence of metabolic activation (Kajiura, 1996).
No mutagenic activity was observed in the mouse lymphoma forward
mutation assay when cultured mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were exposed to up
to 0, 1.2, 2.4, 3.2, 4.2, 5.6, 7.5 or 10 mmol sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate
(No. 1880)/l (0, 278, 557, 743, 975, 1300, 1741 or 2321 μg/ml), with and without S9
metabolic activation. Negative results were seen in a second trial of the assay with
0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mmol sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate/l (0, 145,
290, 580, 1161 or 2321 μg/ml) (Van Delft, 1998a).
There was no indication of mutagenicity in a chromosomal aberration test
when Chinese hamster ovary cells were incubated for 18 h and fixed for 18 h with
0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8 or 9.6 10 mmol sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate/l
(0, 23, 70, 139, 279, 557, 1114 or 2228 μg/ml) with S9 metabolic activation. In a trial

HYDROXY- AND ALKOXY-SUBSTITUTED BENZYL DERIVATIVES (addendum)

545

using 3-h treatment time and 18-h fixation and 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 mmol sodium
4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate/l (0, 290, 580, 1160 or 2321 μg/ml) with S9 metabolic
activation, negative results were obtained. In the absence of S9 metabolic

Reproductive/developmental toxicity studies

In an embryotoxicity/teratogenicity study, 28 mated female Wistar rats per
group were fed a diet providing 0, 0.5, 1 or 2% sodium 4-methoxybenzoyloxyacetate
(No. 1880), which the authors report as average daily intakes of 0, 200–400, 500–
700 and 1000–1400 mg/kg bw per day from day 0 to day 21 of gestation. There
were no signs of maternal toxicity, fetotoxicity or embryotoxicity. Based on these
results, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was set at 2% (1000–1400 mg/kg bw
per day) (Wolterbeek & Waalkens-Berendsen, 1999).

The Committee evaluated a group of 14 flavouring agents that includes
11 alkyl isothiocyanates (Nos 1884–1891 and 1893–1895) and 3 mercaptoisothiocyanates (Nos 1892, 1896 and 1897). The evaluations were conducted
according to the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents established at the forty-ninth meeting (Figure 1, Introduction) (Annex 1, reference 131).
None of these flavouring agents has previously been evaluated by the Committee.
The Committee evaluated 16 other members of this group of flavouring
agents at its sixty-fifth meeting (Annex 1, reference 177). All the substances were

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

concluded to be of no safety concern based on current estimated levels of intake;
however, the evaluation was conditional for 10 of these substances, because the
estimated exposure was based on anticipated annual volumes of production. At the
present meeting, actual volumes of production for these substances were provided,
and the Committee confirmed that these 10 substances were of no safety concern
based on current estimated levels of intake.
Twelve of the 14 substances (Nos 1884–1890, 1892–1894, 1896 and 1897)
have been reported to occur naturally in foods. They have been detected in
cabbages, radish, mustards, wasabi, garlic, bread, milk and wines (Nijssen et al.,
2007).
1.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The total annual volume of production of the 14 flavouring agents in this
group is approximately 913 kg in Japan (Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials
Association, 2002). More than 54% of the total annual volume of production in
Japan is accounted for by a single substance in this group—namely, 4-pentenyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1893), which has an estimated per capita intake of 132 μg/
person per day. More than 37% of the total annual volume of production is
accounted for by two other substances in this group—namely, 3-butenyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1889) and 5-hexenyl isothiocyanate (No. 1894), which have
estimated per capita intakes of 50 and 40 μg/person per day, respectively. The
estimated per capita intakes of all the other flavouring agents in the group range
from 0.03 to 12 μg/person per day (Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association,
2002), with most of the intake values at the lower end of this range. The estimated
per capita intake of each flavouring agent is reported in Table 1. Annual volumes of
production of this group of flavouring agents are summarized in Table 2.
1.3

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination

Isothiocyanates are readily absorbed and distributed to all major tissues in
studies in rodents. Peak concentrations in these tissues are achieved between 2
and 8 h after dosing. Metabolic studies in humans, mice and rats indicate that
isothiocyanates react readily with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form a conjugate
as the primary metabolite and that the reaction is catalysed enzymatically by
glutathione S-transferase, although a slower non-enzymatic reaction can also
occur. Both reactions occur in a pH-dependent equilibrium. In rats, the Nacetylcysteine conjugates appear as the major metabolites in urine, whereas some
isothiocyanate–GSH conjugates are excreted into bile.

Sixteen flavouring agents in this group were previously evaluated by the Committee at its sixty-fifth meeting (Annex 1, reference 177).
b
Step 1: Twelve of the flavouring agents (Nos 1884–1890, 1892–1894, 1896 and 1897) in this group were assigned to structural class II, and the remaining
two flavouring agents (Nos 1891 and 1895) were assigned to structural class III.
c
Step 2: None of the flavouring agents in this group can be predicted to be metabolized to innocuous products. In addition, there were toxicological concerns
associated with these substances.

The thresholds of concern for structural classes II and III are 540 and 90 μg/day, respectively. All intake values are expressed in μg/day. The combined
per capita intakes of the five flavouring agents with the highest volume in a homologous series of linear saturated isothiocyanates in structural classes
II and III are 2 and 0.89 μg/person per day in Europe and Japan, respectively. The combined per capita intake of the four flavouring agents with the
highest volume in a homologous series of branched-chain saturated isothiocyanates in structural class II is 16 μg/person per day in Japan. The
combined per capita intakes of the four flavouring agents with the highest volume in a homologous series of linear saturated mercapto-isothiocyanates
in structural class II are 13, 52 and 3.2 μg/person per day in Europe, the USA and Japan, respectively. The combined per capita intakes of the four
flavouring agents with the highest volume in a homologous series of linear unsaturated isothiocyanates in structural class II are 1502, 133 and

Application of the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring
Agents

Step 1.

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents to the
above-mentioned flavouring agents, the Committee assigned 12 (Nos 1884–
1890, 1892–1894, 1896 and 1897) to structural class II and the remaining 2
(Nos 1891 and 1895) to structural class III (Cramer et al., 1978).

Step 2.

Although conjugation with GSH is the major pathway of metabolism for alkyl
isothiocyanates, a significant proportion of the excreted metabolites were not
identified in studies in animals. Therefore, none of the flavouring agents in this
group can be predicted to be metabolized to innocuous products. In addition,
because of toxicological concerns (possible effects on the urinary bladder), the
evaluation of these 14 flavouring agents proceeded via the B-side of the
Procedure.

Step B3.

The estimated daily per capita intakes of all 12 of the flavouring agents in
structural class II and of both of the flavouring agents in structural class III are
below the thresholds of concern for their class (i.e. 540 μg/day for class II;
90 μg/day for class III). Therefore, the evaluation of all 14 flavouring agents in
the group proceeded to step B4.

Step B4.

For methyl isothiocyanate (No. 1884), ethyl isothiocyanate (No. 1885),
isobutyl isothiocyanate (No. 1886), isoamyl isothiocyanate (No. 1887),
isopropyl isothiocyanate (No. 1888), 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (No. 1889), 2butyl isothiocyanate (No. 1890), amyl isothiocyanate (No. 1891), 4-pentenyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1893), 5-hexenyl isothiocyanate (No. 1894) and hexyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1895), the no-observed-effect level (NOEL)1 of 12 mg/kg
body weight (bw) per day for the structurally related flavouring agent allyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1560) from a 2-year study in rats and mice treated via

According to the decision taken by the Committee at its sixty-eighth meeting (Annex 1,
reference 187), this would now be termed a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL).

560

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

gavage (National Toxicology Program, 1982) is appropriate because they are
all alkyl isothiocyanates and will be metabolized via similar metabolic pathways.
The NOEL of 12 mg/kg bw per day for allyl isothiocyanate (No. 1560) provides
margins of safety in the range of 5400–24 000 000 in relation to their estimated
levels of intake.
For 4-(methylthio)butyl isothiocyanate (No. 1892), 5-(methylthio)pentyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1896) and 6-(methylthio)hexyl isothiocyanate (No. 1897),
the NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw per day for the structurally related flavouring agent
3-(methylthio)propyl isothiocyanate (No. 1564) from an 84-day feeding study in
rats (Harper et al., 1961) is appropriate because they are all linear mercaptoisothiocyanates and will be metabolized via similar metabolic pathways. The
NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw per day for 3-(methylthio)propyl isothiocyanate (No.
1564) provides margins of safety in the range of 600 000–15 000 000 in relation
to their estimated levels of intake.

Table 1 summarizes the evaluations of the 14 miscellaneous nitrogencontaining substances in this group.
1.5

Consideration of combined intakes from use as flavouring agents

In the unlikely event that the flavouring agents in a homologous series of
linear saturated isothiocyanates in structural classes II and III, of which the highest
intakes correspond to Nos 1561, 1884, 1885, 1891 and 1895 in Europe and Japan,
were to be consumed concurrently on a daily basis, the estimated combined intakes
of 2 and 0.89 μg/person per day in Europe and Japan, respectively, would not
exceed the thresholds of concern (i.e. 540 μg/person per day for class II and
90 μg/person per day for class III).
In the unlikely event that the flavouring agents in a homologous series of
branched-chain saturated isothiocyanates in structural class II, of which the highest
intakes correspond to Nos 1886, 1887, 1888 and 1890 in Japan, were to be
consumed concurrently on a daily basis, the estimated combined intake of 16 μg/
person per day in Japan would not exceed the threshold of concern (i.e. 540 μg/
person per day for class II).
In the unlikely event that the flavouring agents in a homologous series of
linear saturated mercapto-isothiocyanates in structural class II, of which the highest
intakes correspond to Nos 1564, 1892, 1896 and 1897 in Europe, the USA and
Japan, were to be consumed concurrently on a daily basis, the estimated combined
intakes of 13, 52 and 3.2 μg/person per day in Europe, the USA and Japan,
respectively, would not exceed the threshold of concern (i.e. 540 μg/person per day
for class II).
In the unlikely event that the flavouring agents in a homologous series of
linear unsaturated isothiocyanates in structural class II, of which the highest intakes
correspond to Nos 1560, 1889, 1893 and 1894 in Europe, the USA and Japan, were
to be consumed concurrently on a daily basis, the estimated combined intakes
would be 1502, 133 and 222 μg/person per day in Europe, the USA and Japan,
respectively. The estimated combined intake would exceed the threshold of concern
in Europe (i.e. 540 μg/person per day for class II). The intake in Europe, however,
is due mainly to allyl isothiocyanate (No. 1560). Allyl isothiocyanate has a NOEL of

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

561

12 mg/kg bw per day in 2-year studies in rats and mice, which provides a margin of
safety of 480 in relation to the estimated level of intake. The overall evaluation of
the data indicates that combined intake would not raise safety concerns.
1.6

Consideration of secondary components

No flavouring agents in this group have minimum assay values of less
than 95%.
1.7

Conclusion

In the previous evaluation of substances in this group, studies of acute
toxicity, short-term and long-term studies of toxicity and studies of genotoxicity were
available. None raised safety concerns. The toxicity data available for this
evaluation supported those from the previous evaluation.
The Committee concluded that these 14 flavouring agents, which are
additions to the group of miscellaneous nitrogen-containing substances evaluated
previously, do not give rise to safety concerns at the current estimated levels of
intake.

RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION

2.1

Explanation

This monograph summarizes the additional key data relevant to the
safety evaluation of the group of 14 miscellaneous nitrogen-containing substances
that includes 11 alkyl isothiocyanates (Nos 1884–1891 and 1893–1895) and 3
mercapto-isothiocyanates (Nos 1892, 1896 and 1897).
2.2

Additional considerations on intake

2.3

Biological data

2.3.1 Biochemical data: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
(a)

Oxazoles, oxazolines, pyrimidines and pyrazoles

There has been no additional information on the absorption, distribution,
metabolism or excretion of these flavouring agents since the preparation of the
original monograph (Annex 1, reference 177).
(b)

Isothiocyanates

(i) Absorption, distribution and excretion
Data on the absorption, distribution and excretion of isothiocyanates indicate
that these flavouring agents are rapidly absorbed, metabolized and excreted in

562

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

experimental animals. Benzyl isothiocyanate (No. 1562), phenethyl isothiocyanate
(No. 1563) and methyl isothiocyanate (No. 1884) are rapidly absorbed by rodents
following oral exposure (Brusewitz et al., 1977; Lam et al., 1993; Ji et al., 2005).
Isothiocyanates, at doses ranging from 1.7 to 80 mg/kg bw, are rapidly absorbed,
metabolized and excreted, primarily in the urine (Brusewitz et al., 1977; Lam et al.,
1993; Kassahun et al., 1997; Ji et al., 2005).
In experiments that investigated the metabolism of benzyl isothiocyanate,
oral administration of 20 or 80 mg/kg bw of the cysteine conjugate of [7-14C]benzyl
isothiocyanate to Wistar rats led to rapid absorption of more than 98% of the
radiolabel from the gastrointestinal tract, followed by excretion of 87–98% of the
radioactivity in the urine and 6% in the faeces. Mean plasma concentrations (43 and
24 μg-equivalent/ml in males and females, respectively) peaked at 45 min and then
dropped rapidly (half-life, 1–2 h), suggesting rapid excretion. After 3 days, less than
0.5% of the radioactivity remained in the carcass. In two rats with cannulated bile
ducts, a mean of 3.9% of the radiolabel was found in the bile, indicating that biliary
secretion was not a primary route for benzyl isothiocyanate excretion (Brusewitz
et al., 1977).
Following an intraperitoneal dose of 0.05 mmol [14CH3]-labelled methyl
isothiocyanate/kg bw (equivalent to 4.0 mg/kg bw) administered to male SwissWebster mice, the radiolabel was broadly distributed in the tissues at 6, 24 and
48 h, with the highest levels of residual 14C retained in the liver and kidneys. After
48 h, more than 94% of the radiolabel was recovered, with urine (>80%) providing
the major route of elimination and the faeces (5%) and expired carbon dioxide (4%)
constituting minor routes of excretion. Approximately 6% of the radiolabel remained
in the carcass after 48 h (Lam et al., 1993).
Phenethyl isothiocyanate doses of 2, 10, 100 or 400 μmol/kg bw were given
to male Sprague-Dawley rats by intravenous injection. At the lowest dose level of
2 μmol/kg bw (326 μg/kg bw), the pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the
curve [AUC], 2.96 μmol/l per hour; clearance, 0.70 l/h per kilogram; volume of
distribution, 1.94 l/kg; and degradation half-life, 3.52 h) indicated that phenethyl
isothiocyanate was rapidly absorbed, distributed and eliminated. The half-life values
were significantly longer at 100 and 400 μmol/kg bw than at 2 μmol/kg bw (P < 0.05),
suggesting that as the dose increased, metabolic detoxication pathways (i.e.
mercapturic acid) approached saturation (Ji et al., 2005).
Plasma concentrations peaked at 0.44 and 2.0 h after doses of 10 and
100 μmol phenethyl isothiocyanate/kg bw, respectively, were given by oral gavage
to rats. The maximal plasma concentrations were 9.2 and 42.1 μmol/l after doses
of 10 and 100 μmol/kg bw, respectively. The similar AUC values observed for
intravenous and oral administration demonstrate that phenethyl isothiocyanate is
almost completely absorbed after oral administration (Ji et al., 2005).
(ii) Metabolism
Data on the metabolic fate of isothiocyanates indicate that they are
principally detoxicated by conversion to GSH conjugates. Studies on a number of
aromatic, aliphatic and further functionalized isothiocyanates have demonstrated

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

563

that they are conjugated with reduced GSH and eliminated primarily in the urine as
the corresponding N-acetylcysteine (mercapturic acid) conjugate (Brusewitz et al.,
1977; Mennicke et al., 1983, 1988; Ioannou et al., 1984; Eklind et al., 1990).
The metabolic fate of benzyl isothiocyanate and its cysteine conjugate was
investigated in rats utilizing in vivo models. Only the mercapturic acid conjugate was
detected in the urine 20 h after male Wistar rats were given 10 mg doses of benzyl
isothiocyanate by oral gavage. The mercapturic acid conjugate was also detected
following the intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of the cysteine and Nacetylcysteine conjugates of benzyl isothiocyanate to rats (Brusewitz et al., 1977).
In the same study, starved CFHB Wistar rats were dosed orally with the
cysteine conjugate of [14C]benzyl isothiocyanate (20 mg/kg bw) as a suspension in
aqueous 0.5% weight by volume (w/v) gum tragacanth (2 ml). The radioactivity was
well absorbed and rapidly excreted, with mean peak plasma concentrations of
radioactivity occurring within 45 min. More than 92% of the radioactivity was
excreted in the urine over 3 days. The primary radioactive metabolite (62% of dose)
corresponded to the mercapturic acid of benzyl isothiocyanate (Brusewitz et al.,
1977).
Similar results were found when two Wistar rats were given oral doses of L[35S]cysteine hydrochloride for 4 days to enrich their sulfur pool with radiolabelled
cysteine. One rat was then given the non-radiolabelled cysteine conjugate of benzyl
isothiocyanate, and the other was used as the control. Two other rats that had not
been pretreated with the 35S-enriched cysteine were then administered either a
[35S]cysteine conjugate of benzyl isothiocyanate or the cysteine conjugate of
[7-14C]benzyl isothiocyanate. Urinary analysis for either the rat administered
unlabelled benzyl isothiocyanate cysteine conjugate after pretreatment with [35S]cysteine or the rat administered the [35S]cysteine conjugate of benzyl isothiocyanate
with no pretreatment revealed the same major radioactive metabolite, [35S]mercapturic acid of benzyl isothiocyanate. These data suggest that the cysteine
conjugate on benzyl isothiocyanate partially reverts to free benzyl isothiocyanate in
vivo, which is then reconjugated with [35S]GSH. Urinary analysis for the rat given
[7-14C]benzyl isothiocyanate revealed that some of the cysteine conjugate is
converted directly to the mercapturic acid derivative without prior regeneration of
free benzyl isothiocyanate (Brusewitz et al., 1977).
The metabolic fate of methyl isothiocyanate was investigated in rats and
mice in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered [13CH3]methyl
isothiocyanate at approximately 33 mg/kg bw via oral, intraperitoneal and
intravenous routes. Regardless of the mode of administration, the corresponding
mercapturate and GSH conjugates were the primary metabolites in the urine and
bile, respectively (Lam et al., 1993).
In an attempt to quantify these and other metabolites, male Sprague-Dawley
rats and male albino Swiss-Webster mice were treated intraperitoneally with
[14CH3]methyl isothiocyanate at a dose equivalent to 4.0 mg/kg bw (Lam et al.,
1993). Forty-eight hours after administration, analysis of the urine revealed that the
major metabolite in the rat was the mercapturic acid conjugate of methyl
isothiocyanate (28% of the 14C in urine). In mice, the mercapturic acid conjugate

564

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

accounted for only 2.1% of the 14C found in the urine. In both animals, a large
percentage of radiolabelled, unidentified, highly polar metabolites were present in
the urine after 48 h. The authors suggested that the majority of the [14C]methyl
isothiocyanate undergoes extensive degradation to formaldehyde and formic acid,
and the radiolabel is then redistributed throughout the tissues (Lam et al., 1993).
A single 50 mg/kg bw dose of 4-(methylthio)butyl isothiocyanate or
sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane, a naturally occurring
isothiocyanate present in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli) was given to
male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection (Kassahun et al., 1997). In
bile, the GSH and mercapturic acid conjugates of 4-(methylthio)butyl isothiocyanate
and sulforaphane were identified. Additionally, the urine of sulforaphane-dosed rats
gave metabolites identified as the mercapturic acid conjugates of sulforaphane and
4-(methylthio)butyl isothiocyanate. A third metabolite was assumed to be the
mercapturic acid conjugate of ǻ1-sulforaphane, a minor (desaturated) metabolite of
sulforaphane (Kassahun et al., 1997). These data support the evidence for
isothiocyanates being metabolized via GSH conjugation and subsequently
eliminated as mercapturic acid conjugates.
The metabolic fates of benzyl isothiocyanate and its conjugates were
investigated in vitro using rat whole-tissue homogenates. The GSH, cysteinylglycine
or cysteine conjugates of benzyl isothiocyanate (6 μmol) were incubated with either
liver or kidney homogenate at 37 ºC for 30 min. Although the GSH conjugate formed
the cysteine conjugate of benzyl isothiocyanate in either homogenate, the
conversion was complete in the presence of kidney homogenate, suggesting that
the formation of the cysteine conjugate from the GSH conjugate occurs more readily
in the kidney. The cysteinylglycine conjugate formed both GSH and cysteine
conjugates in the liver homogenate, but only the cysteine conjugate in kidney
homogenate. The mercapturic acid conjugate was detected when the cysteine
conjugate was incubated with liver or kidney homogenates in the presence of acetylcoenzyme A (CoA). In the absence of acetyl-CoA, reduced acetylation occurred,
indicating that sufficient acetyl-CoA in the homogenates was available to produce
the mercapturic acid conjugate (Brusewitz et al., 1977).
Collectively, these data support the conclusion that isothiocyanates are
detoxicated primarily via conjugation with GSH and subsequent conversion to the
mercapturic acid conjugate (Barnes et al., 1959; Boyland & Chasseaud, 1967;
Brusewitz et al., 1977).

(i) Butyl isothiocyanate (No. 1561), benzyl isothiocyanate (No. 1562),
phenethyl isothiocyanate (No. 1563) and ethyl isothiocyanate (No. 1885)
Groups of 6-week-old F344 rats (20 per sex) were maintained on a diet
containing 0.1% of benzyl isothiocyanate or phenethyl isothiocyanate (equivalent
to 100 mg/kg bw per day) for 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. Rats (five per sex per group) were
sacrificed on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7. No obvious clinical signs, growth retardation or
loss of appetite occurred in any group. Urine samples collected on days 0, 1 and 7
revealed a transient reduction in pH in both groups on day 1 only and significant
reductions in sodium and chloride in both groups. The urinary bladders, ureters,

566

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

kidneys and liver were removed at necropsy. The thickness of the urinary bladder
epithelium increased with treatment in both sexes of each group and was more
prominent in males than in females. In general, bladder inflammation peaked on
day 2 or 3 and consisted of neutrophil infiltration, cytoplasmic vacuolation, necrosis
and haemorrhage. On day 7, slight bladder epithelial hyperplasia was reported.
There were no noteworthy changes in the ureter, kidney or liver (Akagi et al., 2003).
In another series of experiments, 12 groups of male rats were fed benzyl
isothiocyanate, phenethyl isothiocyanate or 10 other structurally related substances
at levels calculated to provide an estimated daily intake of 80 mg/kg bw in each
group for 14 days. Urine samples were collected on days 0 (controls only), 1 and
14. At necropsy on day 14, urinary bladders, ureters, kidneys and liver were
examined. Urinary analysis for all treated groups except the ethyl isothiocyanate
(No. 1885) group resulted in pH and electrolyte changes as reported in the previous
experiment. Treatment with phenethyl isothiocyanate produced epithelial
hyperplasia and an increased incidence of papillary or nodular hyperplasia, whereas
phenyl isothiocyanate and butyl isothiocyanate (No. 1561) produced hyperplasia at
a much greater incidence (>80%). There were no noteworthy changes in the other
organs examined (Akagi et al., 2003).
As part of a study to evaluate the tumour-promoting activity of
isothiocyanates in rats pretreated with diethylnitrosamine and N-butyl-N(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, groups of male rats (six per group) were maintained
on 0.1% diets (equivalent to 100 mg/kg bw per day) of benzyl isothiocyanate or
phenethyl isothiocyanate for 32 weeks. Weekly measurement of body weight and
food consumption revealed no significant differences between test and control
groups. At necropsy, liver, kidneys and urinary bladder were excised, and liver and
kidney weights were recorded. Relative liver weight was significantly (P < 0.001)
increased for both test substances, and relative kidney weight was increased
(P < 0.01) for the phenethyl isothiocyanate group. Histopathological evaluation of
the urinary bladder revealed epithelial hyperplasia in all animals in the benzyl
isothiocyanate and phenethyl isothiocyanate groups. One animal in both the benzyl
isothiocyanate and phenethyl isothiocyanate groups was reported to exhibit
papillomas, and two animals in the phenethyl isothiocyanate group exhibited
carcinomas. These results are consistent with those reported for rats exposed to
high concentrations of other irritant isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocyanate
(Annex 1, reference 177). There was no increase in the incidence of foci (>0.5 mm),
adenomas or carcinomas in the livers of benzyl isothiocyanate– or phenethyl
isothiocyanate–treated rats (Hirose et al., 1998).
In a subsequent study at the same laboratory, groups of male F344 rats were
maintained on a basal diet or diets containing 0.1% (100 mg/kg bw per day) of
phenethyl isothiocyanate for either 32 or 48 weeks. The 32-week group was then
maintained on a basal diet for an additional 1, 3 or 7 days or 16 weeks prior to
sacrifice. All animals were given an intraperitoneal injection of a 100 mg/kg bw dose
of 5-bromo-2ƍ-deoxyuridine 1 h before sacrifice. Biweekly measurement of body
weight and food consumption revealed decreased weight gain (6–8%) after 32
weeks, which slightly recovered in rats returning to a basal diet. At necropsy, liver,
kidneys and urinary bladder were removed and weighed. Relative bladder weights

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

567

of the 32-week group were significantly increased compared with those of controls.
For groups returned to a basal diet, relative bladder weights gradually decreased
over the next 16 weeks. Bladder thickening was reported in all treated groups.
Histopathological examination revealed bladder epithelial hyperplasia and a high
incidence of dysplasia in all treatment groups. The incidence of carcinomas
increased from 7 days (2/6) to 16 weeks (7/12) in the 32-week treatment group,
reaching a highest incidence (11/12) in the 48-week group. Most carcinomas
were transitional epithelial cell carcinomas. Cell proliferative activity as measured
by 5-bromo-2ƍ-deoxyuridine labelling indices was increased during exposure to
100 mg/kg bw per day of phenethyl isothiocyanate. Labelling indices markedly
decreased in papillary and nodular hyperplastic lesions during the 16 weeks after
phenethyl isothiocyanate exposure, whereas labelling indices decreased only
slightly for dysplasias and carcinomas, supporting the conclusion that there was
irreversible development of non-papillary carcinomas from dysplasia. Mutation
analysis of tumours (12) indicated that a majority (58%) had mutations in the p53
gene (Sugiura et al., 2003).
The promoting activity of isothiocyanates suggested in previous experiments
could be due to alteration of the urine composition, the production of urinary solids
or effects exerted on the urothelium by the free isothiocyanate or a reactive
metabolite. Currently, there is no evidence that isothiocyanates produce an increase
in urinary solids or calculi or change urinary composition. Free isothiocyanates are
known to be skin irritants. When high concentrations of isothiocyanates or their
metabolites are excreted in the urine, they may act as potent irritants. Continuous
irritation leads to urothelial cytotoxicity, regenerative hyperplasia, dysplasia and
eventual development of bladder transitional cell carcinomas (Annex 1, reference
177; Cohen, 1998).
Irritation leading to tumorigenesis in the urinary bladder has been previously
reported and is dependent upon administration of relatively high concentrations of
the agent, and a clear threshold effect is observed (Arnold et al., 1997). Below this
threshold, continuous irritation of the urothelium and carcinogenesis do not occur.
Interestingly, the urinary bladder effects occur almost exclusively in the male rat.
No effects have been observed in mice. These sex- and species-specific differences
may be due to different toxicokinetics or to differences in urothelium resistance to
irritant and cytotoxic effects.
In considering the safety of isothiocyanates, these effects occur only at high
doses in rats. Even if it was assumed that humans would be susceptible to this mode
of action, the level of exposure to these substances is highly unlikely to be sufficient
to produce similar effects.

(i) In vitro
Evidence of mutagenicity has been reported for methyl isothiocyanate (No.
1884) in a bacterial gene mutation assay (His+ reversion) in Salmonella
typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, with maximum effects seen in both strains at
a concentration of 100 μg/plate. Exposure to higher doses caused a decline in
mutant frequencies as a result of toxicity. Negative results were obtained in both
strains for methyl isothiocyanate in the presence of metabolic activation (Kassie et
al., 2001a, 2001b).
The extent of repairable deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage induced by
isothiocyanates was measured by comparing the viability of two Escherichia coli
strains that differed in their DNA repair capacity (343/753 and 343/765). At a methyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1884) concentration of 11 μg/ml, the survival of the repairdeficient strain (343/765) relative to that of the repair-proficient strain (343/753) was
reported to be less than 50%, but the absolute survival rates were not reported. The
effect of methyl isothiocyanate on the relative survival rate of the two strains was
reduced in the presence of metabolic activation (Kassie et al., 2001a, 2001b).
In a micronucleus assay in human-derived HepG2 cells, methyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1884) at a concentration of 4 μg/ml induced approximately a 2fold increase in the frequency of micronuclei. However, at this same concentration,
significant cytotoxicity (~50%) was reported after a 1-h exposure (Kassie et al.,
2001a, 2001b).

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

In a comet (single-cell gel electrophoresis) assay using human-derived
HepG2 cells, the average comet tail length for cells treated with methyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1884) at 5.4 μg/ml was more than twice that of untreated cells.
Cell viability at this concentration was not reported, and higher concentrations of
the compound reduced cell viability by up to 70% (Kassie et al., 2001a, 2001b).
Allyl isothiocyanate (No. 1560), butyl isothiocyanate (No. 1561), benzyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1562), ethyl isothiocyanate (No. 1885) and isobutyl
isothiocyanate (No. 1886) were reported to give positive results in a bacterial
reverse mutation assay when tested at concentrations of 100–150 μg/plate without
metabolic activation in S. typhimurium strain TA100. The number of revertants per
plate varied among each sample, with allyl isothiocyanate having the highest
potency (among those tested). There was no increase in mutagenicity with
metabolic activation (Yamaguchi, 1980).
Positive results have also been reported in a bacterial reverse mutation
assay with allyl isothiocyanate (No. 1560), 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (No. 1889) and
4-pentenyl isothiocyanate (No. 1893). At concentrations of 125–320 μg/plate, the
agents showed the effect of reducing the revertant numbers, with and without
metabolic activation, in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. However, at the
highest dose concentration (320 μg/plate), colony survival was reduced in the cells
to 12–66% compared with controls (Uda et al., 1992).
(ii) In vivo
In an in vivo host-mediated differential DNA repair assay, groups of six male
Swiss albino mice were injected with 4–8 × 109 viable cells of a mixture of E. coli
strains 343/753 (uvrB/recA/Lac+) and 343/765 (uvr+/rec+/Lací), differing in their DNA
repair potential. Immediately following the injection, methyl isothiocyanate was
administered via gavage (90 or 270 mg/kg bw). Two hours later, animals were
sacrificed, and homogenized organ suspensions (liver, lungs, kidneys, stomach and
colon) were prepared on neutral red agar plates for 12 h to allow growth of the DNA
repair-deficient/proficient bacterial strains (343/753 and 343/765). At the higher
dose (270 mg/kg bw), acute toxicity was observed, and all animals died before the
end of the exposure period. At 90 mg methyl isothiocyanate/kg bw, the authors
reported only marginal positive effects in the liver and no statistically significant
effects in the lungs, kidneys or colon. Based on these results, the authors concluded
that methyl isothiocyanate is effectively detoxicated in the living animal. In earlier
studies, the same authors found experimental evidence for isothiocyanates
generating reactive oxygen radicals and causing lipid peroxidation, both of which
can induce DNA damage (Kassie et al., 1999). Accordingly, and in conjunction with
the marginal genotoxic effects seen at 90 mg/kg bw, the authors attributed the
apparent positive in vitro genotoxic effects of methyl isothiocyanate to DNA damage
caused by reactive oxygen species or lipid peroxidation, especially at doses that
can lead to acute toxic symptoms (Kassie et al., 2001a, 2001b).

(iii) Conclusions from genotoxicity studies
Bacterial mutagenicity testing of isothiocyanates in standardized bacterial
reverse mutation assays using a variety of strains has shown no consistent evidence
of mutagenicity. In the absence of metabolic activation, both positive (Yamaguchi,
1980; Eder et al., 1982; Brooks et al., 1984; Kassie & Knasmüller, 2000; Kassie et
al., 2001a, 2001b) and negative (Neudecker & Henschler, 1985; Mortelmans et al.,
1986) results have been reported, usually at or near cytotoxic concentrations (see
also Annex 1, reference 177). In studies with metabolic activation, positive results
were reported in modified Ames assays using preincubation conditions conducive
to depletion of metabolic detoxication pathways (Neudecker & Henschler, 1985;
Uda et al., 1992). Furthermore, equivocal evidence of isothiocyanate genotoxicity
has been reported in in vitro clastogenic assays (sister chromatid exchange,
chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei) (Kasamaki et al., 1982; Kasamaki &
Urasawa, 1985; Galloway et al., 1987; Musk & Johnson, 1993; Kassie et al., 1999,
2001a, 2001b; Kassie & Knasmüller, 2000).
Conditions in most of these studies provided the opportunity for either direct
interaction with DNA or indirect formation of DNA adducts due to oxidative stress
and subsequent cytotoxicity. Numerous studies have shown that test conditions
(e.g. cytotoxicity, ionic strength, low pH) and culture conditions (e.g. hypo- and
hyperosmolality, high pH) can induce increased DNA damage (Zajac-Kaye & Ts’o,
1984; Brusick, 1986; Bradley et al., 1987; Galloway et al., 1987; Seeberg et al.,
1988; Morita et al., 1989; Scott et al., 1991), leading to DNA fragmentation, which
can cause false-positive responses in genotoxicity assays (Meintières & Marzin,
2004). The metabolism of isothiocyanates in vitro and in vivo may lead to depletion
of GSH levels and a release of nucleocytolytic enzymes that induce DNA damage.
At low dose levels, it is likely that isothiocyanates exhibit limited genotoxic activity.
(d)

Reproductive and developmental studies

(i) Benzyl isothiocyanate (No. 1562)
In a two-generation reproductive toxicity study, benzyl isothiocyanate was
administered via gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats at levels of 0, 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg
bw on pregnancy days 1–5 (preimplantation) or 7–13 (post-implantation). The body
weights of rats treated with the flavouring agent before fetal implantation were
recorded on days 1, 5, 10 and 16, whereas rats treated post-implantation were
weighed on days 7, 11, 15 and 20 of gestation. Pregnant females were observed
for vaginal bleeding and signs of clinical toxicity. Pre- and post-implantation rats
were euthanized on days 16 and 20, respectively, and the numbers of implantation
sites, viable fetuses and fetal resorptions were analysed following necropsy. The
weights of viable fetuses and their placentas were documented, and the viable
fetuses were observed for external malformations. Maternal liver, kidney and
spleen weights were also recorded. Pregnant rats treated with benzyl
isothiocyanate prior to implantation were observed to display hypoactivity, perinasal
staining, piloerection and hunched posture. There was also a dose-dependent
decrease in the body weights of these rats during the treatment period. Early fetal
resorptions, number of implantation sites and relative weights of liver, kidney and

572

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

spleen showed no significant differences from those of the controls. However, two
maternal deaths were recorded immediately after the treatment period (day 6) in
the group of rats treated with 50 mg benzyl isothiocyanate/kg bw. In pregnant rats
treated with benzyl isothiocyanate after fetal implantation, signs of toxicity were also
observed, typified by lethargy, ruffled fur, perinasal staining and hunched posture.
A dose-dependent decrease in body weights of the treated rats was recorded during
the treatment period. There were no significant differences in either the number of
fetal resorptions or the relative weights of liver, kidney and spleen compared with
the controls. One maternal death was recorded after the treatment period (day 14)
in the group treated with 50 mg benzyl isothiocyanate/kg bw. There were no
significant differences in the number of viable fetuses in the treatment group, and
external examination of viable fetuses did not reveal any important findings.
However, fetal weights in rats treated with 25 and 50 mg benzyl isothiocyanate/kg
bw, as well as the placental weights in all treatment groups, were significantly lower
than in the controls (Adebiyi et al., 2004).
(e)

Anti-carcinogenesis studies

A variety of isothiocyanates have been studied for their ability to inhibit
carcinogenesis, which occurs mainly through blocking carcinogen metabolic
activation and enhancing carcinogen detoxication (Hecht, 2000; Conaway et al.,
2002; Thornalley, 2002). In co-carcinogenicity studies, administration of various
isothiocyanates prior to dosing with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK) inhibited the activation of the carcinogen by cytochrome P450 (CYP)
isoforms found in the rat lung (Smith et al., 1990; Guo et al., 1992, 1993). In a study
in rats, benzyl isothiocyanate, when administered simultaneously with N-butyl-N-(4hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, inhibited the urinary bladder carcinogenic effects of the
nitrosamine compound (Okazaki et al., 2002). Similarly, dietary administration of
phenethyl isothiocyanate or sulforaphane [(í)-1-isothiocyanate-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane] reduced the incidences of NNK activation in rat lung and resulted in fewer
lung tumours (Morse et al., 1989; Boysen et al., 2003; Conaway et al., 2005).
However, rat liver tumour formation was not significantly affected, and, in general,
the inhibition by isothiocyanates of carcinogen-activating CYPs is isoform selective
and depends on the structure of the alkyl or aryl group attached to the isothiocyanate
functional group. 6-Phenylhexyl isothiocyanate, for instance, is the most potent
inhibitor of CYP2B1 (Conaway et al., 1996), whereas sulforaphane is a strong and
selective inhibitor of CYP3A4 (Mahéo et al., 1997).
A second mechanism for anti-carcinogenic activity may be the induction by
isothiocyanates of phase II enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases and
quinone reductase, thus increasing the rate of carcinogen detoxication. In one study
in humans, numerous isothiocyanates were shown to increase glucuronidation
levels, resulting in increases of nicotinoid glucuronides excreted in the urine (Hecht
et al., 1999). As with CYP inhibition, the effectiveness and specificity of activation
are tissue specific and dependent upon the structure of the alkyl or aryl group
attached to the isothiocyanate functionality. For instance, phenethyl isothiocyanate
is an effective inducer of quinone reductase and glutathione S-transferase in the
liver, but not in the lung or nasal mucosa (Guo et al., 1992). Similarly, treatment with

MISCELLANEOUS NITROGEN-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES (addendum)

573

sulforaphane results in dose-dependent induction of glutathione S-transferases A1/
A2 and P1, but not M1 (Mahéo et al., 1997).
A third mechanism for anti-carcinogenic activity is via induction of apoptosis.
In human cells and in rodent models, allyl isothiocyanate, phenethyl isothiocyanate
and benzyl isothiocyanate have been shown to induce apoptosis by affecting signal
transduction pathways. This occurs through mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase pathway activation, and evidence suggests that oxidative stress by
isothiocyanates is involved in the activation (Yu et al., 1996; Huang et al., 1998; Xu
& Thornalley, 2001). In in vitro studies, phenethyl isothiocyanate and allyl
isothiocyanate inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in human leukaemia cells
(Xu & Thornalley, 2000). Phenethyl isothiocyanate has also been shown to induce
p53 expression–dependent apoptosis and to sensitize cells to Fas-mediated
apoptosis (Huang et al., 1998; Pullar et al., 2004). As with metabolic alteration, the
effects of isothiocyanates on apoptosis are dependent upon the chemical structure.
For example, 6-phenylhexyl isothiocyanate appears to inhibit apoptosis during
azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis (Samaha et al., 1997). Conversely,
sulforaphane activates apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells (Gamet-Payrastre
et al., 2000).

The Committee evaluated a group of 10 flavouring agents structurally related to menthol, including 4 esters of menthol (Nos 1852, 1854, 1855 and 1858),
1 ketone (No. 1856), 3 alicyclic alcohols or ethers (Nos 1853, 1860 and 1861), 1
diketone (No. 1857) and 1 ketal (No. 1859). The evaluations were conducted
according to the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents
established by the Committee at its forty-ninth meeting (Figure 1, Introduction)
(Annex 1, reference 131). None of these flavouring agents has previously been
evaluated by the Committee.
At its fifty-first meeting, the Committee evaluated menthol and 13 other
members of this group of flavouring agents (Annex 1, reference 137). All 14 agents
in that group were concluded to be of no safety concern based on current estimated
levels of intake.

SUBSTANCES STRUCTURALLY RELATED TO MENTHOL (addendum)

Five of the 10 additional flavouring agents in this group are natural
components of foods (Nos 1852, 1860, 1856, 1857 and 1861). They have been
detected in a variety of peppermint and cornmint oils, honeys, teas, starfruit, shrimp,
lemon balm, citrus peel oils and cognac (Nijssen et al., 2007).
1.2

Assessment of dietary exposure

The total annual volume of production of the 10 substances structurally
related to menthol is approximately 409 kg in Europe (European Flavour and
Fragrance Association, 2005), 485 kg in the USA (Gavin et al., 2007) and 162 kg in
Japan (Japan Flavor & Fragrance Materials Association, 2002). The estimated daily
per capita intake of each flavouring agent is reported in Table 1. Annual volumes of
production of this group of flavouring agents are summarized in Table 2.
1.3

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination

The menthyl esters in this group (Nos 1852, 1854, 1855 and 1858) can be
expected to be readily hydrolysed to menthol and their respective carboxylic acids
(Heymann, 1980; Anders, 1989). Carboxylesterases are found in the endoplasmic
reticulum of most mammalian tissues (Hosokawa et al., 2001), but occur
predominantly in hepatocytes (Heymann, 1980; Graffner-Nordberg et al., 1998;
Hosokawa et al., 2001). The metabolites of menthol are eliminated in the urine
and/or faeces either unchanged or conjugated with glucuronic acid (Yamaguchi et
al., 1994). The ketal (No. 1859) is expected to be hydrolysed to yield (í)- or (±)menthone and simple glycols (Heymann, 1980). The ketone menthone is primarily
reduced to the corresponding secondary alcohol, neomenthol, which is metabolized
and eliminated by pathways similar to those of its stereoisomer, menthol (Williams,
1940). The ketones (Nos 1856 and 1857) in this group would be reduced to their
corresponding secondary alcohols and conjugated mainly with glucuronic acid
(Quick, 1928; Williams, 1940; Atzl et al., 1972). The alicyclic alcohols (Nos 1853,
1860 and 1861) are expected to be conjugated mainly with glucuronic acid and
eliminated in the urine or faeces.
1.4

Application of the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring
Agents

Step 1.

In applying the Procedure for the Safety Evaluation of Flavouring Agents to this
group of flavouring agents, the Committee assigned five of the flavouring agents
(Nos 1852–1855 and 1860) to structural class I (Cramer et al., 1978). The
remaining five flavouring agents (Nos 1856–1859 and 1861) were assigned to
structural class II (Cramer et al., 1978).

Step 2.

All the flavouring agents in this group are expected to be metabolized to
innocuous products. The evaluation of all flavouring agents in this group
therefore proceeded via the A-side of the Procedure.

Step A3.

The estimated daily per capita intakes of all five of the flavouring agents in
structural class I are below the threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per
day for class I). The estimated daily per capita intakes of all five of the flavouring
agents in structural class II are below the threshold of concern (i.e. 540 μg/
person per day for class II).

Intake (μg/person per day) calculated as follows: [(annual volume, kg) × (1 × 109 μg/kg)]/
[population × survey correction factor × 365 days], where population (10%, “consumers only”)
= 32 × 106 for Europe, 28 × 106 for the USA and 13 × 106 for Japan; and where correction
factor = 0.8 for the surveys by the USA, Europe and Japan, representing the assumption that
only 80% of the annual flavour volume was reported in the poundage surveys (Japan Flavor
& Fragrance Materials Association, 2002; European Flavour and Fragrance Association,
2005; Gavin et al., 2007).
Intake (μg/kg bw per day) calculated as follows: (μg/person per day)/body weight, where
body weight = 60 kg. Slight variations may occur from rounding.
c
Quantitative data for the USA reported by Stofberg & Grundschober (1987).

The consumption ratio is calculated as follows: (annual consumption via food, kg)/(most
recent reported volume as a flavouring substance, kg).

Table 1 summarizes the evaluations of the 10 additional flavouring agents
structurally related to menthol (Nos 1852–1861) in this group.
1.5

Consideration of combined intakes from use as flavouring agents

The daily intakes of the 10 additional flavouring agents structurally related
to menthol considered in this group are all relatively low in comparison with
those of the previously considered flavouring agents in this group (Annex 1,
reference 137). In the unlikely event that the flavouring agents in structural class I
with the common metabolite menthol (No. 427) from this group (Nos 1852, 1854,
1855 and 1858) and the previously evaluated group (Nos 432, 433 and 447) were
to be consumed together with menthol (No. 427) on a daily basis, the estimated
combined intakes1 would be 1527 μg/person per day in Europe and 3513 μg/person
per day in the USA. The estimated combined intake would therefore exceed the
human threshold of concern (i.e. 1800 μg/person per day for class I) in the USA.
However, the vast majority of the combined intake would be due to menthol per se,
which has an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–4 mg/kg bw, established by the
Committee at its fifty-first meeting (Annex 1, reference 37). Also, all 10 flavouring
agents and the 14 flavouring agents considered previously are expected to be
metabolized efficiently and would not saturate available metabolic pathways. The
overall evaluation of the data indicated that combined intake would not raise safety
concerns.
1.6

Consideration of secondary components

No flavouring agents in this group have minimum assay values of less
than 95%.

1

Combined intake was calculated on a molar basis relative to the formation of a common
metabolite. In this case, the common metabolite is menthol, with a relative molecular mass
of 156.69.

Conclusion

In the previous evaluations of substances in this group, studies of acute
toxicity, short-term and long-term studies of toxicity and studies of genotoxicity were
available. None raised safety concerns. The toxicity data available for this
evaluation supported those from the previous evaluations.
The Committee concluded that these 10 flavouring agents, which are
additions to the group of substances structurally related to menthol evaluated
previously, do not give rise to safety concerns at the current estimated levels of
intake.

This monograph summarizes additional key data relevant to the safety
evaluation of a group of 10 flavouring agents structurally related to menthol,
including 4 esters of menthol (Nos 1852, 1854, 1855 and 1858), 1 ketone (No.
1856), 3 alicyclic alcohols or ethers (Nos 1853, 1860 and 1861), 1 diketone (No.
1857) and 1 ketal (No. 1859).
2.2

Additional considerations on intake
There is no additional information on estimated daily intake.

2.3

Biological data

2.3.1 Biochemical data: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
No significant new information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
excretion of these agents has been reported since the report of the fifty-first meeting
(Annex 1, reference 137).
2.3.2 Toxicological studies
(a)

Acute toxicity

Oral median lethal doses (LD50 values) have been reported for three
substances in this group and are summarized in Table 3. In rats, LD50 values range
from >2000 mg/kg bw for 2-(l-menthoxy)ethanol (No. 1853) to 9600 mg/kg bw for
menthyl pyrrolidone carboxylate (No. 1858) (Edwards et al., 1977a; Moreno, 1977;
Shirai, 2003).
LD50 values reported in mice range from 4500 to 5200 mg/kg bw for menthyl
pyrrolidone carboxylate (No. 1858) (Fairey, 1977a, 1977b).

(i) Menthyl pyrrolidone carboxylate (No. 1858)
Groups of 4-week-old Colworth Wistar rats (eight per sex per dose) were fed
0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 or 2% menthyl pyrrolidone carboxylate in the diet for 3 weeks. These
dietary levels were equivalent to daily intakes of 0, 120, 610, 1210 or 2390 mg/kg
bw per day for males and 0, 130, 620, 1280 or 2530 mg/kg bw per day for females.
Food and water intake and individual body weights were recorded weekly. At
necropsy, haematological, serum biochemical and urine analyses were conducted.
Select organs (e.g. brain, spleen, heart, kidney, liver, adrenals and testes) were
weighed, and tissue samples were prepared for histological evaluation. One female

590

SUBSTANCES STRUCTURALLY RELATED TO MENTHOL (addendum)

rat in the 2% dose group died on day 3 of the study as a result of not eating the diet.
At the 2% dose level, there was a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in food intake in
male rats and a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in body weight gains in both sexes.
There were significant changes in a number of serum biochemical values in both
sexes in the 1% and 2% dose groups, probably related to the reduced food intake
at the higher dose levels. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher relative kidney weights were
reported in male rats administered 2% menthyl pyrrolidone carboxylate, but not in
female rats. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher relative liver weights were also reported
in both sexes in the 2% dose group animals, but these changes were not
accompanied by any histological changes. The no-observed-adverse-effect level
(NOAEL) was 0.5% menthyl pyrrolidone carboxylate in the diet, equivalent to 610
and 620 mg/kg bw per day for males and females, respectively (Edwards et al.,
1977a).
In a follow-up study, groups of 4-week-old rats (10 per sex per dose) were
fed 0, 0.07, 0.14, 0.7 or 1.4% menthyl pyrrolidone carboxylate in the diet for 13
weeks. These dietary levels were equivalent to daily intakes of 0, 57, 109, 563 or
1111 mg/kg bw per day for males and 0, 71, 127, 710 or 1388 mg/kg bw per day
for females. Food and water intake and individual body weights were recorded
weekly. At necropsy, haematological, serum biochemical and urine analyses were
conducted. Select organs (e.g. brain, spleen, heart, kidney, liver, adrenals and
testes) were weighed, and tissue samples were prepared for histological evaluation.
Significantly (P < 0.05) reduced body weight gain was reported in female rats fed
the 1.4% diet. Relative kidney and liver weights were significantly increased in male
rats fed the 1.4% and 0.7% diets and in female rats fed the 1.4% diet. Although
histological examination revealed centrilobular hypertrophy in the liver of male rats
fed the 1.4% diet, it was not accompanied by other histopathological changes in the
liver and may be an adaptive response resulting from cytochrome P450 induction.
Males fed the 1.4% diet exhibited increased numbers of hyaline droplets in the
proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys. This is considered to be related to the
aggregation of Į-2u-globulin in the renal proximal tubules (National Toxicology
Program, 1990; Lehman-McKeenan & Caudill, 1994) and is a male rat–specific
effect (Bucher et al., 1986; Swenberg et al., 1989). The NOAEL was 0.14% menthyl
pyrrolidone carboxylate in the diet, equivalent to 109 and 127 mg/kg bw per day for
males and females, respectively (Edwards et al., 1977b).
(c)

Genotoxicity

(i) 2-(l-Menthoxy)ethanol (No. 1853) and l-Menthyl (R,S)-3-hydroxybutyrate
(No. 1855)
No evidence of mutagenicity was reported in modified bacterial reverse
mutation assays when 2-(l-menthoxy)ethanol (No. 1853) and l-menthyl (R,S)-3hydroxybutyrate (No. 1855) were incubated with various strains of Salmonella
typhimurium and with Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA at concentrations up to
10 000 μg/plate, with and without metabolic activation (Sasaki, 2003; Morimoto,
2005) (Table 5).

FOOD ADDITIVES AND INGREDIENTS EVALUATED
TOXICOLOGICALLY OR ASSESSED FOR DIETARY EXPOSURE

Food additive

Specificationsa

ADI “not specified”b when used in the
applications specified and in accordance
with good manufacturing practice.
ADI of 0–20 mg/kg bw based on a NOEL
of 2000 mg/kg bw per day from a 90-day
toxicity study and a safety factor of 100.

Asparaginase from Aspergillus N
niger expressed in A. niger
Calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) N
The suffix (40–65) reflects the
weight-average molecular
weight range (40 000–65 000)
to distinguish it from other
calcium lignosulfonates in
commerce.

Ethyl lauroyl arginate

Paprika extract

Acceptable daily intake (ADI)
and other toxicological
recommendations

The maximum potential dietary exposure
to calcium lignosulfonate (40–65) was low
and not expected to exceed 7 mg/kg bw
per day from use as a carrier of fat-soluble
vitamins and carotenoids in food and
supplements.
ADI of 0–4 mg/kg bw for ethyl lauroyl
arginate, expressed as ethyl-NĮ-lauroyl-Larginate HCl, based on a NOAEL of
442 mg/kg bw per day in two reproductive
toxicity studies and a safety factor of 100.

N

The Committee noted that some of the
estimates of high dietary exposure
(greater than 95th percentile) exceeded
the ADI, but recognized that these
estimates were highly conservative and
that actual intakes were likely to be within
the ADI range.
The Committee did not allocate an ADI.
Concern was expressed as to whether the
material tested in the 90-day and longterm studies was representative of all
commercial production of paprika extract
used as food colour. The fact that the
material tested contained less than 0.01%
capsaicin and the fact that the Committee
did not receive adequate data to establish
a limit for capsaicin in the specifications
for paprika extract added to this concern.

N, T

Since the source material and
the manufacturing process
differ for paprika preparations
used as a spice and as a food
colour, the name “paprika
extract” was adopted for use as
a food colour, leaving the term
“paprika oleoresin” for use as a
spice.

New tentative specifications were
prepared, pending receipt of additional

information on paprika extract used as
food colour, including concentrations of
capsaicin (to differentiate from materials
used as flavours) and additional
information about the composition of
batches of extract produced by a variety
of manufacturers.
ADI “not specified”b when used in the
applications specified and in accordance
with good manufacturing practice.
Group ADI of 0–40 mg/kg bw for
phytosterols, phytostanols and their
esters, expressed as the sum of
phytosterols and phytostanols in their free
form, based on an overall NOAEL of
4200 mg/kg bw per day to which a safety
factor of 100 was applied. The overall
NOAEL was identified using the
combined evidence from several shortterm (90-day) studies of toxicity. The
Committee considered the margin
between this overall NOAEL and the
lowest LOAEL from the 90-day toxicity
studies of 9000 mg/kg bw per day as
adequate for this overall NOAEL to be
used as the basis for establishing an ADI.
This conclusion is supported by the
results of the available studies of
reproductive toxicity.
Based on available data, the Committee
concluded that dietary exposure to
phytosterols and phytostanols would
typically be within the ADI range.
Temporary ADI of 0–0.8 mg/kg bw for
PDMS, based on the previous ADI and
applying an additional safety factor of 2.
The previously established ADI of
0–1.5 mg/kg bw was withdrawn. Results
of studies to elucidate the mechanism and
relevance of ocular toxicity observed in
the submitted toxicology studies, as well
as data on actual use levels in foods,
should be provided before the end of 2010.
The temporary ADI applies to PDMS that
meets the revised specifications
prepared.
ADI of 0–4 mg/kg bw expressed as
steviol, based on a NOEL of 970 mg/kg

ANNEX 4

Acceptable daily intake (ADI)
and other toxicological
recommendations
bw per day from a long-term experimental
study with stevioside (383 mg/kg bw per
day expressed as steviol) and a safety
factor of 100. The results of the new
studies presented to the Committee
showed no adverse effects of steviol
glycosides when taken at doses of about
4 mg/kg bw per day, expressed as steviol,
for up to 16 weeks by individuals with type
2 diabetes mellitus and individuals with
normal or low-normal blood pressure for
4 weeks.

Sulfites
Assessment of dietary
exposure

Some estimates of high-percentile dietary
exposure to steviol glycosides exceeded
the ADI, particularly when assuming
complete replacement of caloric
sweeteners with steviol glycosides. The
Committee recognized that these
estimates were highly conservative and
that actual intakes were likely to be within
the ADI range.
The main contributors to total dietary
exposure to sulfites differ between
countries owing to differing patterns of
use of sulfites in foods and of
consumption of foods to which sulfites
may be added. Thus, dried fruit, sausages
and non-alcoholic beverages were the
main contributors of sulfites in some
countries, whereas these foods are
generally produced without the use of
sulfites in other countries. In countries
where wine is regularly consumed, it was
one of the main contributors to dietary
exposure in adults. Dietary exposure in
high regular consumers of wine (97.5th
percentile) was shown to exceed the ADI
for sulfites (0–0.7 mg/kg bw) based on
MLs in Codex GSFA, MLs in national
legislation or the average concentration
determined analytically (about 100 mg/l).
In children and teenagers, a significant
contribution to mean exposure to sulfites
could come from fruit juices and soft
drinks (including cordial), sausages,
various forms of processed potatoes,
dried fruit and nuts.

The Committee provided
recommendations on further relevant
actions to be considered by countries and
the Codex Alimentarius Commission.

N, new specifications prepared; R, existing specifications revised; T, tentative specifications.

b

ADI “not specified” is used to refer to a food substance of very low toxicity that, on the basis
of the available data (chemical, biochemical, toxicological and other) and the total dietary
intake of the substance arising from its use at the levels necessary to achieve the desired
effects and from its acceptable background levels in food, does not, in the opinion of the
Committee, represent a hazard to health. For that reason, and for the reasons stated in the
individual evaluations, the establishment of an ADI expressed in numerical form is not
deemed necessary. An additive meeting this criterion must be used within the bounds of
good manufacturing practice, i.e. it should be technologically efficacious and should be used
at the lowest level necessary to achieve this effect, it should not conceal food of inferior
quality or adulterated food, and it should not create a nutritional imbalance.

The Committee concluded that the data reviewed on the six alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes provide evidence of toxicity and carcinogenicity to rodents
given high doses for several of these substances. A mechanistic understanding of
these effects and their implications for human risk have yet to be fully explored and
will have a significant impact on the assessment of health risks from alkoxysubstituted allylbenzenes at the concentrations at which they occur in food.

The Committee concluded that the Procedure could not be applied to this
group, because of the unresolved toxicological concerns. Studies that would assist
in the safety evaluation include investigations of the influence of the nature and
position of ring substitution on metabolism and on covalent binding to
macromolecules. Depending on the findings, additional studies might include
assays related to the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of representative
members of this group.

Re-evaluation of safety of certain flavourings

At the fifty-ninth, sixty-first, sixty-third and sixty-fifth meetings of the
Committee (Annex 1, references 160, 166, 173 and 178), only “anticipated” annual
volumes of productions were provided for some flavouring agents and used in the
MSDI calculation. These volumes were used for expedience in completing a safety
evaluation, but the conclusions of the Committee were made conditional pending
the submission of actual poundage data.

ANNEX 4

627

Actual production volumes were subsequently submitted for all 143 requested flavouring agents and were evaluated by the Committee. The two flavouring
substances requiring a re-evaluation were No. 1414, L-monomenthyl glutarate, and
No. 1595, 2-isopropyl-N,2,3-trimethylbutyramide.
The Committee concluded that the Procedure could not be applied to
2-isopropyl-N,2,3-trimethylbutyramide because of evidence of clastogenicity in the
presence, but not in the absence, of metabolic activation.

3-Hexenal glyceryl acetal and hexanal glyceryl acetal
are expected to share the same metabolic fate as the
primary substance, i.e. hydrolysis to the corresponding
aldehydes and alcohols, followed by complete
metabolism in the fatty acid pathway or the tricarboxylic
cycle. They do not present a safety concern at current
estimated levels of intake of the flavouring agent.

A group ADI of 0–0.5 mg/kg bw, expressed as citral,
was established for citral, geranyl acetate, citronellol,
linalool and linalyl acetate by the Committee at its
twenty-third meeting (Annex, reference 50). At the
sixty-first meeting of the Committee, when citral
(No. 1225) was evaluated using the Procedure, citral
was concluded to be of no safety concern at current
estimated levels of intake as a flavouring agent, and
the ADI was maintained (Annex 1, reference 166).

6–8% hexyl trans-3-hexenoate Hexyl trans-3-hexenoate is expected to share the
same metabolic fate as the primary substance, i.e.
hydrolysis to 3-hexenoic acid and hexanol, followed by
complete metabolism in the fatty acid pathway or the
tricarboxylic cycle. It does not present a safety concern
at current estimated levels of intake of the flavouring
agent.

7% 3-methylene-2-octanone

An ADI of 0–10 mg/kg bw was established for vanillin
by the Committee at its eleventh meeting (Annex,
reference 14). At the fifty-seventh meeting of the
Committee, when vanillin (No. 889) was evaluated
using the Procedure, vanillin was concluded to be of

2,6,8-Trimethyl-6-hydroxy-4-nonanone, cis-2,6,8trimethyl-5-nonen-4-one and trans-2,6,8-trimethyl5-nonen-4-one are expected to share the same
metabolic fate as the primary substance, i.e. reduction
of the ketone followed by glucuronic acid conjugation.
They do not present a safety concern at current
estimated levels of intake of the flavouring agent.

3-Methylene-2-octanone (No. 1149) was evaluated by
the Committee at its fifty-ninth meeting (Annex 1,
reference 160) and was concluded to be of no safety
concern at current estimated levels of intake as
flavouring agent.

5–6% methyl trans-3-octenoate Methyl trans-3-octenoate is expected to share the
same metabolic fate as the primary substance, i.e.
hydrolysis to 3-octenoic acid and methanol, followed
by complete metabolism in the fatty acid pathway or
